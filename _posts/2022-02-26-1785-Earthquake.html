<p class="body">The Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p class="body">Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by Night, all day.</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Talk to me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Real quick what's happening hey, what's up Joe great</p>
<p class="body">To see you man, thanks for having me first of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">All my pleasure</p>
<p class="body">Listen, your special is ******* outstanding is one of the best specials I've seen in a long time</p>
<p class="body">It's hard to laugh by yourself out loud on a phone when you're watching someone on the phone</p>
<p class="body">I laughed hard, but it was great</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, sometimes someone does a special and it's like</p>
<p class="body">It's you</p>
<p class="body">It's like</p>
<p class="body">He's better seeing him live, but right you captured</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">It was some</p>
<p class="body">It would</p>
<p class="body">It was the journey</p>
<p class="body">It was the first time I was properly financed</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Uh, we was in borrowing money or had the right vehicle properly supported by the distributors and everything, so it was</p>
<p class="body">It was the opportunity then I knew the significance of it by Dave being a part of it, that this is the one I needed to elevate me to get off at this level that I'm on</p>
<p class="body">Right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're one of the best comics alive</p>
<p class="body">There's no, there's no doubt about it so</p>
<p class="body">This is a great representative of that</p>
<p class="body">It's a great representation of that 'cause</p>
<p class="body">It's very rare that someone gets as good as you are</p>
<p class="body">That's not selling out arenas like, that's how good you</p>
<p class="body">Are well, thank you so it's it's exciting for me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, and you know I hope</p>
<p class="body">But you know, if you comic man you never know what's gonna do it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I never had a problem with. I never equated quantity with quality. So when I've seen people with 1517 eighteen thousand, I never felt inferior or bad that I had. 2000, right right? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">The work of it and then at the end of the day, to be quite honest</p>
<p class="body">With you as a comic, you know it when you first get into it</p>
<p class="body">You stay with you just just want to make people laugh and I have achieved that</p>
<p class="body">So I had already filled that</p>
<p class="body">I was successful, but sometimes you do sit back like God Dam, when did they ever going to get to? </p>
<p class="body">The east, they keep skipping me</p>
<p class="body">How long does it take? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, 'cause you you know I said in in my echo the thing I'm saying I've been the bridesmaid for so long and never the bride and watch all my friends just get TV shows and everything and like you said I look at my friends, they and ICM</p>
<p class="body">Talent wise I don't feel it</p>
<p class="body">I just look at him and say they</p>
<p class="body">They had an opportunity and they achieved and they and they won on it, and they cashed in on it</p>
<p class="body">I have yet to have that opportunity to cash in, so that's what I'm looking for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the fact that Dave Chappelle is behind it that Dave Produciton</p>
<p class="body">He introduces you at the beginning of the special, that's that's gigantic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's kinda that's gonna help a lot, but we've all been talking about you for years</p>
<p class="body">Everyone is terrified to follow you</p>
<p class="body">Everyone would find out that you were at the comedy store</p>
<p class="body">Everybody is like oh **** where is he at in the lineup? </p>
<p class="body">FCK that spot</p>
<p class="body">That spot after you is not fun</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean with you have nothing but your jokes</p>
<p class="body">You gotta least perfect that aspect of the</p>
<p class="body">The career</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Career well you're a hustler</p>
<p class="body">Two, you're always out there and the guys that are constantly working</p>
<p class="body">There's a Polish that you get when you're on the road and you're doing those</p>
<p class="body">Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sundays when you just constantly doing sets, there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's an undeniable Polish that a guy gets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean you there I call him the frontline workers</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Success takes you off the frontline</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">It does</p>
<p class="body">It it it, it keeps you from your fans to feel exact 'cause we we feed off the information that we get from our fans</p>
<p class="body">Keeps you</p>
<p class="body">And if you are isolated with security or other things that you have to do or the month you know the enormous of your career, you kind of like get away from the people that are actually</p>
<p class="body">Support you, and that's the key to me</p>
<p class="body">I always stay within my constituents some way family member or somebody</p>
<p class="body">I take a young comedian on the road with me, who I I look up to and say he can make it and just allow him to be in the life and I just watch what he do and what he's going through</p>
<p class="body">And that's why I keep my my stuff shocked</p>
<p class="body">Keep my</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah I do this</p>
<p class="body">I do the same</p>
<p class="body">Yeah I do the same and I also bring</p>
<p class="body">A lot of comedians to the shows that I do in town bring open my cars</p>
<p class="body">I bring, you know, have them go up</p>
<p class="body">I give them tips</p>
<p class="body">Give him good spots</p>
<p class="body">You know, let him let him try it out</p>
<p class="body">Give him rough spots</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes after someone really good, let him feel that you know, and I think for a lot of guys a lot of guys get big and then they start getting television shows and movies and you don't realize how much time that takes away</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, let him feel that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">From your</p>
<p class="body">Stand up when I was doing fear factor</p>
<p class="body">I remember like seeing guys that would come into town</p>
<p class="body">You know that we're doing the road constantly and I'd be jealous</p>
<p class="body">I I would</p>
<p class="body">I was on a television show hit show but and you know, and everybody wanted to be on a hit show but I would see these guys that were so smooth because they just been doing those Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday two shows Friday</p>
<p class="body">Two shows Saturday Sunday on the road and</p>
<p class="body">They would just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just greased up and just smooth and just</p>
<p class="body">Everything was polished, yes</p>
<p class="body">That's the that's the top level</p>
<p class="body">You know when you get to that when you're headlining constantly and you just your, your act is just so polished</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and you can see it too and relevant and they talking about things you're like, damn</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I didn't see it that</p>
<p class="body">Damn, you know what I mean</p>
<p class="body">So it's the beautiful part</p>
<p class="body">That's what I look for</p>
<p class="body">You never seen it this way you never seen this</p>
<p class="body">Angle of it, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's the best</p>
<p class="body">When you watch a comic in these say something that you would never expected and you're like, wow, that's that's a nice angle</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's a nice angle</p>
<p class="body">The craft</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That's that's the hook</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's the sweet spot we call it in the pocket</p>
<p class="body">That's when you're in the pocket, you get it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Where did you record this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Washington DC night</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, at home</p>
<p class="body">I'm from Washington DC, Southeast DC</p>
<p class="body">So when they came to me where you want to go, I said, well, let's go ahead and make it as rough as possible</p>
<p class="body">Let's go and do it at home</p>
<p class="body">Lily, everybody be here, so at least if nothing else, I I stamped my hometown</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's right, you talk about that in the beginning</p>
<p class="body">Of it</p>
<p class="body">Yes, is it the other guy that you know I've had on recently who's also it's undeniable and unbelievable that he's not huge are his tonewoods 
<p class="body">Yes, yeah</p>
<p class="body">I had Tony Woods on recently and then we did a show together at the Vulcan</p>
<p class="body">I'm like *** **** he's good</p>
<p class="body">He's so smooth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Me and Tony been friends for over 25 years</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, me too</p>
<p class="body">I've known Tony from since the 90s</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, Tony is my man</p>
<p class="body">He's from DC too and he has that slow delivery and</p>
<p class="body">Sarcastically and it's it's beautiful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">When you write, do you sit down and write? </p>
<p class="body">Do you just collect information throughout the day? </p>
<p class="body">Like how do you? </p>
<p class="body">How do you come? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Up with material I never I write in my mind</p>
<p class="body">I never physically write what I do</p>
<p class="body">I come up with a concept</p>
<p class="body">And elaborate on it, and usually it comes with a true well for truth and then it expand to a big assly</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Like they say, the first casualty of war is the</p>
<p class="body">Truth, so that's what it is</p>
<p class="body">Here it is</p>
<p class="body">And then I just expand on it, expand on it, expand on it so when I get on stage I never know what I'm gonna say</p>
<p class="body">But once I see it then I just say what I see 'cause I see it in my mind and then I just</p>
<p class="body">It comes out that way, that's how I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do it so when you write new material, do you just go up with it or do you try to sandwich? </p>
<p class="body">It in between material that you've already do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, like this right here? </p>
<p class="body">I say I this is what I'm not gonna talk about</p>
<p class="body">I take everything like this special</p>
<p class="body">I'm not gonna talk about any of that</p>
<p class="body">And then I'll start from then on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So like so you take all the material that you're not going to do anymore</p>
'cause you did it in the special, but when you like, say, if you have a new bit that you're trying to work in your act, do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Try to do it first</p>
<p class="body">Do you try to? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I I do it right there</p>
'cause I know where it is to be funny with it</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean so</p>
<p class="body">Uhm, I'll start</p>
<p class="body">Just say what I find is funny</p>
<p class="body">Like we going through this thing with Kuwait</p>
<p class="body">I mean with you COVID Ukraine excuse me and I like OK, the Russians are marching</p>
<p class="body">They're marching so you start from that point on</p>
<p class="body">And just elaborate all way through</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And you just work it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">On stage, right there on stage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Working interesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I work it right on</p>
<p class="body">Stage, have you always done? </p>
<p class="body">It that way, always, really, yeah</p>
<p class="body">See I had my own comedy club and it was the Uptown comedy corner and the Comedy Act theater wouldn't allow me to perform there</p>
<p class="body">So when I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">With that 
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not in Atlanta, GA, so they wouldn't let me perform there, so I told my mother they gonna learn my mother said I told you if they're not gonna let you ride their bike, you either get your</p>
<p class="body">Own bike or walk</p>
<p class="body">So like I I got my own club and because I was affiliated with this dude they said it's not all black comedy clubs</p>
<p class="body">White dudes in problem</p>
<p class="body">Owning so they kind of like boycotted my club, so they left me there to do all the jokes and I had to entertain them so I was able to just go up there and just go</p>
<p class="body">And it was the best thing ever happened before</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Who the **** boycotted? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Other comedians and you know back in the day, because you know, back in the day you've been in the game long</p>
<p class="body">If you work</p>
<p class="body">This club you can't work this club</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know comedy like Theater was</p>
<p class="body">The was the premier black comedy club so you got a club in Los Angeles in Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">That's the premier Black club and it's this new club with the dudes that's not from here</p>
<p class="body">Name Earthquake and the owner say you go up here</p>
<p class="body">You'll never work in my club</p>
<p class="body">What they what you never comedians gonna? </p>
<p class="body">Right no man, I would do your club, Gary said if I go up there I ain't gonna be able to work like I and it was only until Steve Harvey, which is a good friend of mine called him up and said Steve nothing these buffers ain't doing like **** did I do it? </p>
<p class="body">Steve came in, sold it out and when they saw him come see him</p>
<p class="body">They saw me and the rest was history</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, so you were basically working at your club almost every night? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Every night wow, how was the featured? </p>
<p class="body">The open mic in the headline? </p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">That's why people saying they thinking I'm drunk or something leaning up against the wall</p>
<p class="body">That's just what I would do</p>
<p class="body">I used to just leaning up on the wall and do an hour straight off the top and just hit it that way and I just became my style and I just continue on</p>
<p class="body">See what I say</p>
<p class="body">And just riff right off of it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's an amazing gem</p>
<p class="body">To train at, like to to to have that kind of a setup</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of by necessity exact</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Exactly, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Still, that's an amazing way to to work on your ACT</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Holy **** yeah, that's how I do</p>
<p class="body">I just, you know, come up with some different topics and elaborate on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So you didn't do any prep beforehand, like you would never sit down with a notepad and</p>
<p class="body">Right ideas out or anything? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I don't come</p>
<p class="body">I don't do that</p>
<p class="body">What I do is just what I'm gonna start it and I continue on</p>
<p class="body">And then at that I'm going</p>
<p class="body">I tape every show I've ever did, and I suppose been disciplined enough to go back and say, I know it's something that I want to elaborate online later and I I got it down so I could talk about it later</p>
<p class="body">But I never did</p>
<p class="body">I never</p>
<p class="body">That just say **** it, I cooked it</p>
<p class="body">And something else to call</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know any comics do that record and never listen or never watch it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot almost every one of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">OK yeah I got all my shows and I never watched</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That I occasionally would go back and look at them if there's something that I don't remember</p>
<p class="body">I said, I know I said something and</p>
<p class="body">I gotta figure out what</p>
<p class="body">It is I'll</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Go watch, see</p>
<p class="body">That's where it is</p>
<p class="body">Also, Achilles heel if I try to think about what I said</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">It had never come out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, because you? </p>
<p class="body">Be smooth, not in the moment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
'cause I'm thinking? </p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">That one is just for y'all</p>
<p class="body">It was there for that</p>
<p class="body">If I try to capture it and bring it up and take it to Saint Louis</p>
<p class="body">What I did is in Dallas it ain't gonna work</p>
<p class="body">It has to be right then and there, so you just pray you get up there and say God is never</p>
<p class="body">Let me down before and keep on going</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">With it, well, that is one of the beautiful things about your style is that it seems so loose and relaxed and natural</p>
'cause if you can achieve that mindset and just do that every night and never think about the material, just let it flow out</p>
<p class="body">That's a amazing gift, yeah</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Steve told me that too</p>
<p class="body">It's like 'cause I remember</p>
<p class="body">I did get caught up in the comedy club</p>
<p class="body">This is how you supposed to write a joke and everything</p>
<p class="body">And I was writing and you said what you doing</p>
<p class="body">I said right and get my stuff together</p>
<p class="body">He just grabbed a paper, tore it up</p>
<p class="body">He said you don't need the right yo **** come out already don't let him **** what you got and once he told me that it was on wow it was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">On he gave you the advice and not right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah he gave me the advice said don't write it down</p>
<p class="body">Let it be, let it go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I would ordinarily I would argue with that I would say no</p>
<p class="body">I should definitely, right, but then I see what you're doing and</p>
<p class="body">I'm like leave it alone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean I try, I try to conform it in and put it in and I really to be honest with you, I I envy those Polish as comedians</p>
<p class="body">I mean every word like Seinfeld</p>
<p class="body">Let's go here</p>
<p class="body">I mean, polished? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I couldn't</p>
<p class="body">That's not me 'cause mine is like a testimony like preaching</p>
<p class="body">You get caught up in the gospel of it and here you just some words don't come right it 'cause you in it you know what I mean you in it so you know it's like Michael J</p>
<p class="body">And I'm pretty sure it wasn't written down</p>
<p class="body">He got into the song and come on now came and</p>
<p class="body">It worked with the song</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Most of my favorite people perform like that like Joey Diaz, Joey Diaz will go on stage with some **** that happened 5 minutes before they open with</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and you'll be dying laughing and there's no preparation</p>
<p class="body">It's just smooth and natural and just who he is</p>
<p class="body">And you can't achieve that like that's not something that a guy who doesn't do that can do</p>
<p class="body">It's like a rare ability to be able to just be smooth and loose like right away with a bit</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean it's is is to be because we already know that it's funny in our head</p>
<p class="body">Now we just want to tell you just like you said man</p>
<p class="body">Guess what I saw and you want to tell her? </p>
<p class="body">I saw this funny thing and that's what it is</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know what I mean</p>
<p class="body">And if you try to tell the story again, it will</p>
<p class="body">You'll tell the story again, but it will never be like you told it the first time</p>
<p class="body">The second time, the third time the 4th time</p>
<p class="body">It competes, you know, completely, just revolve and revolve to a bigger lie</p>
<p class="body">Tembel funny</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now when you prep for this special, how many shows did you do? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I did two shows, two shows, two shows, no one per night, 11 per night</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Same night</p>
<p class="body">Like a Friday and a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Saturday, Friday and a Saturday</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And which one was the better one? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Second one, I think anybody else said the second one first, when you say let me get it in the captive, the name, the number one objective for me was to make sure it captured who I was</p>
<p class="body">You know, I mean that that and I made sure that was on the first one, then the second one</p>
<p class="body">It was like it's another night at the club</p>
<p class="body">I knew I had that one in the king</p>
<p class="body">They like eating</p>
<p class="body">I do the sex show</p>
<p class="body">You don't want to</p>
<p class="body">We got it in the 1st</p>
<p class="body">Now let me do this one and I did it a</p>
<p class="body">Whole different ways like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">God dam so well</p>

<p class="body">Second show I'm ****** This is 1 bit</p>
<p class="body">When she yelled something out but</p>
<p class="body">So when I do four though, it's just like right away from the beginning</p>

<p class="body">Out so</p>
<p class="body">And tell him I don't mind practicing for war</p>
<p class="body">Y'all fighting for real</p>
<p class="body">I gotta tell you the truth, I ain't</p>
<p class="body">No real soldier</p>
<p class="body">I just got here to get out</p>
<p class="body">Of my mother's house</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did you plan on doing standup eventually? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">No, what happened was I used to just sit there</p>
<p class="body">Anything to get out of work</p>
<p class="body">You know 'cause I was that I was that soldier? </p>
<p class="body">Anything to get out so the USO had a tour</p>
<p class="body">I go then talk a couple of times and that stuff</p>
<p class="body">Anything to get out of the military</p>
<p class="body">I mean get out of work and then come</p>
<p class="body">I saw what's about to happen and I knew they was getting tired of me</p>
'cause I was a terrible soldier</p>
<p class="body">Another man</p>
<p class="body">Came in as a E1 left as a E</p>
<p class="body">One what's that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So what city? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">E1, that's the first stripe you</p>
<p class="body">Get really</p>
<p class="body">Nine years later, still just one strike</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, well you have to do to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Gonna it</p>
<p class="body">Get stripes, UM, some of them</p>
<p class="body">Come with seniority and then they get to a level that you have to pass tests and know all the different aircraft</p>
<p class="body">I think about this</p>
<p class="body">I'm just over here trying to find out what my real purpose is</p>
<p class="body">You the one got me when you said this is a great place to start</p>
<p class="body">You ain't say</p>
<p class="body">Nothing about finish, so let's let's just kick it</p>
<p class="body">Until we break up, you know, like dating a woman like you ain't gonna be my wife till this real woman I wanna mess with come along I just kick it with you and that's with the military wasn't it was the best experience of my life because they opened up my mind</p>
'cause I lived in DC in the segregated and I found out there was people out there like you</p>
<p class="body">That had more in common with me</p>
<p class="body">Didn't difference and it was the best thing ever it's about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's water</p>
<p class="body">OK, so when it's kind of amazing, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because if the war didn't break out, maybe you would have never</p>
<p class="body">Done, stand up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably not, but I would have been out to military</p>
<p class="body">They would have put me out</p>
'cause no advancement, you just can't stay in as evil</p>
<p class="body">But it's probably not</p>
<p class="body">I never thought that this was my destiny or this it was the best decision that day and nothing better hasn't came along</p>
<p class="body">So just when I posed</p>
<p class="body">Be doing so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">My first joke was something about Michael Jackson, yeah, and that was it</p>
<p class="body">That's all I remember</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did you write anything out before you went up there? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Did you know what I? </p>
<p class="body">I tried writing but my hand my Pitman ship is so bad when coming out of public school</p>
<p class="body">It's a damn shame when you can't even read your</p>
<p class="body">My own **** So in my spelling is terrible so that it was</p>
<p class="body">It's like OK, it's Michael Jackson</p>
<p class="body">What did I think about Michael Jackson? </p>
<p class="body">I took it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">From there, so did, did you rehearse it in</p>
<p class="body">Your head like how did you do it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I rehearsed it in the mirror like most comedians, and you know, toothbrushes are hollering and the toothpaste is standing up and everything</p>
<p class="body">But it didn't translate on the stage that time</p>
'cause when I first started doing I just looked up up</p>
<p class="body">Unfortunately, looking up at the sky up at the roof of the plays like a woman ain't making love for money</p>
<p class="body">You know, I'm saying I ain't enjoying it at all, so I am so I got down for my first one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Uhm, did you feel uncomfortable like trying? </p>
<p class="body">To insecure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">The insecurity that's why my name is earthquake</p>
<p class="body">You know, people keep asking why you ain't earthquake</p>
<p class="body">I said the reason I named my name earthquake</p>
'cause if this don't work out</p>
<p class="body">I ain't gonna mess up my good name</p>
<p class="body">So somebody come in and say hey, what's up earthquake? </p>
<p class="body">Hey, my name Nathaniel? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know earthquake</p>
<p class="body">It was earthquake</p>
<p class="body">It was 30</p>
<p class="body">No, that was my brother or somebody, but my name is Nathaniel</p>
<p class="body">I don't even know</p>
<p class="body">Know Earthquake that's hilarious</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I thought it was just from the reaction you got from the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's</p>
<p class="body">Crowd no, it was a insecurity that if this don't workout</p>
<p class="body">I did not **** ** my goodness</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's hilarious 'cause</p>
<p class="body">I thought it was the total opposite</p>
<p class="body">I thought it</p>
<p class="body">Was a cocky move no</p>
<p class="body">Like you're about to cause an earthquake, no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">It was like no</p>
<p class="body">This this don't work out baby</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't be scared</p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't skulle my good name</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's funny because it's a perfect name</p>
<p class="body">For you, I don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Think it really is like it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like it's in the insecurity of</p>
<p class="body">Want to protect your name? </p>
<p class="body">You literally came up with the best nickname</p>
<p class="body">Ever for you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, yeah, and that's how I came</p>
<p class="body">I used to tell the joke</p>
<p class="body">People like how you came in the earthquake</p>
<p class="body">This is happening when your mother take every precautions and not to have a child and you still get pregnant</p>
<p class="body">Having and there's nothing else you can name that child but a natural disaster</p>
<p class="body">That's what I wrote as a joke, but the truth honestly about it was the insecurity that if this don't work, I don't want to mess up</p>
<p class="body">My name? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Were you living in Florida at? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">The time I lived in Florida when I got out I went to Atlanta and I'm from when going to Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">That's when I started seeing what the comedy clubs was like</p>
<p class="body">That's when we start opening up our club two years later</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So that is so you do an open mic</p>
<p class="body">Two years later you have your own club and you're going on</p>
<p class="body">Every day</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, so every you gotta understand I'm I'm Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday</p>
<p class="body">Three shows on Fridays and Saturdays</p>
<p class="body">One on Tuesday one on Wednesday one on Thursday 2 on Sunday, every day for about four straight years</p>
<p class="body">And it's just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And you're doing like an hour every night</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And I'm sure every shop</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Every hour show</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Off the top</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Have you ever read the book Outliers? </p>
<p class="body">No, it's a great book, is that, uh, Malcolm, who is that? </p>
<p class="body">Well, it's a great book and one of the things it's about is they they detail people who are extremely successful and he talks about the amount of time that's required to get really good at something and how many people that look like overnight</p>
<p class="body">Success is the amount of time they put in was extraordinary, and one of the</p>
<p class="body">Things he talks about is The Beatles</p>
<p class="body">The Beatles</p>
<p class="body">They did all these shows in Germany where they were doing like what you were doing where they were doing every ******* night they were doing shows and they had put in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours doing these shows</p>
<p class="body">And so when they first you know air quote made it on the scene they had put in so much time performing so much different than most bands</p>
<p class="body">Because they had done so many shows nightly over and over and over again, yeah, there's no</p>
<p class="body">Substitute for that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Not at all</p>
<p class="body">And and it's the foundation of who I am</p>
<p class="body">So when I have to sit here, I goes in</p>
<p class="body">I go in with the confident knowing</p>
<p class="body">All I gotta do is make sure my environment is pure for me to be able to write the way I do keep my mind straight and I can come up with Al</p>
<p class="body">I didn't come up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">With that album, and when you were doing this like two years in is a very unusual that's that's not a lot of time for someone to be forget about headlining at all</p>
<p class="body">But headlining every ******* night and basically doing being the whole show every night</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we was</p>
<p class="body">We would get some comedians that come on it, but we didn't get any of the main comedians because comedy act wasn't happening</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's such a cocky move to open up your own club two years in, that's amazing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">But they were so vulnerable they was in the bad bad part of town</p>
<p class="body">They didn't serve food and then they the cotton spend more on</p>
<p class="body">And I mean the one that really would bring him down</p>
<p class="body">They were so arrogant with it that they had booked a comic</p>
<p class="body">Two comics for the whole month, same comic every week</p>
<p class="body">Every week 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, that's crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, I remember it was Joe Torre</p>
<p class="body">Joe Torre and Ted Carpenter, and they did the whole month, so when I grow my investors there to get the club, I said look these same 2 going to be here</p>
<p class="body">It's 400 people in here. They got two waitresses plus they ain't got no food. Plus they're in the bad part of town. So what we're going to do, we're going to put it. We're going to put the club</p>
<p class="body">In Buckhead, black people don't go there that much right there because they don't go there</p>
<p class="body">We're gonna call it Uptown</p>
<p class="body">And we're gonna we're gonna serve food we're gonna have valet service we're gonna be in a better part of the town and that's how it got it</p>
<p class="body">So once you any, if you're gonna go up against anybody that you first got to recognize their weakness and wig, you can draw from what they got</p>
<p class="body">And that's why I pivoted all my commercials to him that way</p>
<p class="body">Are you tired of going down to a place you park your car? </p>
<p class="body">And you might don't know who gonna be there and begging you for money</p>
<p class="body">No, come get your jokes up at Uptown Comedy Corner</p>
<p class="body">You know what I'm saying? </p>
<p class="body">Well, you don't see the same comedian over and over again and we have food</p>
<p class="body">And we had prompt service and everything else come to Uptown</p>
<p class="body">So I just</p>
<p class="body">And as you sit there, you give him a comparison</p>
<p class="body">By the time people like, yeah, we like it and that's how</p>
<p class="body">I got him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's amazing though, that you did that two years in like go from your career in the military where you kind of halfass it</p>
<p class="body">You're not fully into it and then all of a sudden you find this new thing and you're all in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, you're all in</p>
<p class="body">You're you're opening up your own club 24 months in? That's crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">But what you know it was out of necessity</p>
'cause I got tired of driving night all the way to Lakeland, FL to get $50 a show and then the biggest one you'll tell a woman. You were comedian</p>
<p class="body">And she's like</p>
<p class="body">I ain't never seen any other comedy act</p>
<p class="body">You know we segregation, we we segregated in the black community? </p>
<p class="body">If you ain't here then you ain't doing it</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">So it ain't done</p>
<p class="body">Just it wasn't as expanded as it is now that they can even imagine this other club</p>
<p class="body">This was the club of all club, the only club</p>
<p class="body">If you didn't work there, you ain't no black comedian</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So, so you had this in your head that you</p>
<p class="body">Wanted to do this</p>
<p class="body">And how did you make that happen? </p>
<p class="body">Like who did you get to invest in it, like how? </p>
<p class="body">Did how did you start a club? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it was this dude named Gary Abdul</p>
<p class="body">He was booked</p>
<p class="body">He was a comedian too and but he booked things and like he used to do little little small places like Denny's for example and put a plywood box up there</p>
<p class="body">Little small place</p>
<p class="body">Sit there and he'll throw a show and he'll book me</p>
<p class="body">To pay me $150 me Ricky smiling, dressed up and we sit down and say what you need to do is we need to open up a black club so I showed it to him and I said this is how we can get him what I previously said say good idea so we all went out and tried to get</p>
<p class="body">Investors, I went to all Deion Sanders Dominique in Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">Hey man</p>
<p class="body">Sure just call this person called this person</p>
************* ain't never do nothing</p>
<p class="body">One one of the person was real</p>
<p class="body">One of the person represented was very honest</p>
<p class="body">We said listen man quick</p>
<p class="body">I get five of these calls a day</p>
<p class="body">He ain't gonna do **** I'm just</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, got that maningo wasted time</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">So lucky Gary found the number one plastic surgery in Atlanta and he invests</p>
<p class="body">But he told us McGee all $10,000. If y'all can flip this and show it can work on a smaller stage, then I get the club</p>
<p class="body">So we went to Birmingham a couple places and turned 10 into about 50 to 60,000 and then when we get that from that point on he said you could do it and he gave us the half a</p>
$1,000,000</p>
<p class="body">To get the club, wow yeah</p>
<p class="body">Doctor Tom wow</p>
<p class="body">Rest in peace</p>
<p class="body">My brother</p>
<p class="body">Wow yeah</p>
<p class="body">White dude was great</p>
<p class="body">He he's giving put all that it ease into women in Atlanta GA</p>
<p class="body">He was the tittays specialist</p>
<p class="body">You know what? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, so have you seen any big tittes in the 90s and the early 2000? It was doctor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Dow and how did you know him? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I didn't my partner Gary at the time knew him any program and and we got together</p>
<p class="body">So I found somebody could do it, but he's just a stipulation for us to do it, and then when I met him and I, I was cool</p>
<p class="body">It was beautiful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you remember the opening night? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, we had 15 people</p>
<p class="body">Yeah wow, yeah it was 15 people</p>

<p class="body">How many seats does it place? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">We were so surprised it hold 250</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah 250 people. Some of the people matter of fact my video person who handles my media for me star she was. That's how we met. I hired her as my waitress</p>
<p class="body">And we've been friends ever since</p>
<p class="body">Wow and I gave her a job to handle all my my social media</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, so you go from there 15 people and was it you the first guy? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">On stage, yeah I had a couple of comedians too</p>
<p class="body">Help me out, but I was the the main man until we was able 'cause he once that club closed then all the comedians</p>
<p class="body">Man, I'm sorry man</p>
<p class="body">I'm gonna get down 'cause now you're the only comedy club</p>
<p class="body">In the city</p>
<p class="body">Right, you know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">But Tilly and it was a battle and it was</p>
<p class="body">It's a blessing in disguise 'cause it made me the beast that I am today</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">When did it start to catch on? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">After Steve left</p>
<p class="body">Once Steve and Steve, he taught me so much</p>
<p class="body">You know, 'cause when he came and said I'm gonna do your club 'cause I couldn't get no headliners, nobody that could draw</p>
<p class="body">And I was like Steve, would you do it? </p>
<p class="body">He was hosting Showtime, replacing I'd do it for you and he came in on a Wednesday</p>
<p class="body">And it was only about</p>
30 people in there</p>
<p class="body">And it's like, oh, and he came in and looked, he said, give him all that money back and come pick me up tomorrow at 5:00 o'clock when we do meet you</p>
<p class="body">I said, what do you mean? </p>
<p class="body">It's 30 people</p>
<p class="body">Steve Harvey don't do no show for 30 people</p>
<p class="body">OK then</p>
<p class="body">And then I I picked him up and he took me to the radio</p>
<p class="body">That's when I learned how powerful media is</p>
<p class="body">And he stopped by and said, let's stop by Dunkin' Donuts 'cause we gotta get some Donuts and some some orange juice</p>
'cause you gotta smooth these jocks egos 'cause they feel you're going to try to take their ******* job and everything you gotta be in good on them</p>
<p class="body">And he come, we got in there at 5:30</p>
<p class="body">Stayed on from 6 to 9</p>
<p class="body">I'll tell you, Joe</p>
<p class="body">When we got back</p>
<p class="body">When we got back he had sold out two on Thursday, 4:00 on Friday, 4:00 on Saturday and two on Sunday</p>
<p class="body">Back in 93 I wrote him a check for $45,000. I didn't even know that kind of money exists in comedy I was saying, Oh yeah, I ain't never going nowhere</p>
<p class="body">I ain't never going nowhere and when I saw him pick up that kind of money and seeing what kind of money can be generated as a comedian</p>
<p class="body">I'll say it this way, I need to be and once all of those people came and seemed, all the things that club had to offer and we did was that and we had valet service and all the things that it could do</p>
<p class="body">It was no turning back after that and they saw me</p>
<p class="body">So that was great</p>
<p class="body">Wow, that would change the whole game</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's a great story</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that changed the whole game, but he said Steve Harvey don't? </p>
<p class="body">That's why I tell people</p>
<p class="body">Steve Harvey</p>
<p class="body">Steve Harvey is always been Steve Harvey all with the ultimate confidence he was like do no show for no 50 people</p>
<p class="body">I said well for this pack</p>

<p class="body">This is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
**** you ping you back 50 people in here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I read an interview with him recently where he said he doesn't want to do stand up right now because his television career is too good and he's worried about cancel culture</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Steve is if they really pull Steve to the side and allow him to speak his mind</p>
<p class="body">You think they was after you? </p>
<p class="body">If they ever allow Steve Harvey to talk, is my well put it this way? </p>
<p class="body">If Steve Harvey ever talked his mind the way he really feels about everything</p>
<p class="body">Beautiful man to watch</p>
<p class="body">I learned so much just watching this craft</p>
<p class="body">Just watching how? </p>
<p class="body">You put it together that rawra even yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I was reading this interview and it seems like he wants to</p>
<p class="body">It seems like he's gonna wait until</p>
<p class="body">He has a certain amount of money</p>
<p class="body">And then go back into comedy</p>
<p class="body">That's what it seemed like to me 'cause he was saying, like they'll they'll come a time</p>
<p class="body">But like right now</p>
<p class="body">I mean he's got family feud</p>
<p class="body">He's always got 5</p>
<p class="body">Different shows on simultaneously. Every time I turn around the show TV's got</p>
<p class="body">Some new show</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I told him give up one of these ********** right? </p>
*** **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Man, I don't know how he does it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">He's a workaholic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, I just don't understand where he has the time</p>
<p class="body">I mean, he doesn't need to like Miss Universe and how the **** does he have the time for all that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">He doesn't sleep and he's a money making machine</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, he got enough money</p>
<p class="body">He just don't got enough he wants</p>
<p class="body">But he's straight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm sure I'm sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">He he's trying to get more</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, The thing is like when you hit that level where you can make that kind of money, you don't really want to</p>
<p class="body">Let it stop</p>
<p class="body">You want to let it accumulate as much as you can, but I think like once you're a comic, you're always going to want to do comedy</p>
<p class="body">You're always going to want to get that</p>
<p class="body">The rush of standup</p>
<p class="body">It might not pay as much as the other things, but there's nothing greater in terms of like the way it feels when you're on stage and you're just murdering and everyone is dying, then that's a that is a groove that very few human beings ever get to slide into</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Who don't want to be the funniest man in the room right? </p>
<p class="body">I tell people all the time we got the greatest job in the world 'cause no matter what you do, said about a good time with your friends</p>
<p class="body">It includes us laughter</p>
<p class="body">They said when you sit there and say, hey man, I was with my boy and we was having</p>
<p class="body">A good time</p>
<p class="body">We was laughing all night bingo</p>
<p class="body">We had the laughing all night</p>
<p class="body">Dudes, you understand we are that we walk with that</p>
<p class="body">We are the good time dudes</p>
<p class="body">You understand, we give good times everywhere</p>
<p class="body">It is</p>
<p class="body">You want your woman</p>
<p class="body">A lot of women describe how much she loved man</p>
<p class="body">I was with him and I swear like we knew each other for the longest and we laughed and kicked and everything always got to put</p>
<p class="body">Laugh in it, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Laugh is included isn't necessary to have it, so I love it man</p>
<p class="body">I mean when you on when it is and you know it's hitting</p>
<p class="body">And you see it, it's beautiful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It is beautiful and it's it's a beautiful thing to watch. Still, you know, I've been doing comedy 33 years</p>
<p class="body">I still love watching it</p>
<p class="body">I still love it and I was worried in the beginning that I wouldn't</p>
<p class="body">I was worried in the beginning that I would get jaded or I would be jealous</p>
<p class="body">I'd watch someone kill</p>
<p class="body">I'm like God</p>
<p class="body">I didn't, I think</p>
<p class="body">Of that, 'cause that's how it was when I was 21 of 21 and dumb. I'd see someone kill</p>
<p class="body">And I'd be like, oh, why is he doing so good? </p>
<p class="body">And then I realized that and I was like, oh, that's so weak</p>
<p class="body">I'm like that's a weakness, like you can't think like that</p>
<p class="body">And then I snapped out of it</p>
<p class="body">And then I just started being a fan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Again, see, that's a good thing about me</p>
<p class="body">I can't watch other comedians 'cause I don't physically right so I have to keep my thought patterns here</p>
<p class="body">So I don't want to watch him and then I see it and then subconsciously I think I came up with it, right? </p>
<p class="body">So the best way to keep myself pure, I don't watch other comics</p>

<p class="body">At all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I I don't watch any count</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Even Dave</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">At all, I don't I I see a part of what they do with their style is</p>
<p class="body">But when they get into their bits and stuff like that, I I tap out</p>
<p class="body">Minds after</p>
<p class="body">I don't even</p>

<p class="body">I've done</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did you watch this special at? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">All just this Wednesday when we had the premiere</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really, yeah you didn't</p>
<p class="body">You weren't involved in any of the</p>
<p class="body">Editing no in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Little Dave and my manager, Jermaine, did it</p>
<p class="body">Wow, 'cause I know if I watch it damn I should have said that I should have said that see that's the gift in the curse with it you're like damn</p>

<p class="body">That's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I forgot to say that part of it damn I put to put that on it so I have yet to perfect</p>
<p class="body">That's at that I like, alright, everything that's supposed that came out in that came out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's never</p>
<p class="body">It's never gonna especially you know you know what you can do and you know, let that like Wednesday was different than Tuesday and it's like</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes one bits better one day and another bits better another day</p>
<p class="body">It's never gonna be exact</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but see that's the blessing of it</p>
<p class="body">You can keep striving for when you see them saying so you could never get jaded</p>
<p class="body">And you can never get burnt</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause if you already set that standard for yourself, trying to strive for perfection, but you probably never do make it</p>
<p class="body">But goddamnit, the journey is weird</p>
<p class="body">That, and that's what it is</p>
<p class="body">Oh, so I don't even watch it on it, it's gone</p>
<p class="body">Let me see what</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It do, yeah, the striving for perfection is where it's at</p>
<p class="body">It is the journey 'cause this don't</p>
<p class="body">The destination is not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Real, not real</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and if and a lot of us comedians swear to God get jaded by that</p>

<p class="body">How so? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Because they already know that there is no perfection so ******* why even try? </p>
<p class="body">But you understand, you see him all the time</p>
<p class="body">You have comedians that's been doing this</p>
<p class="body">As long as my I haven't just gave in giving up</p>
<p class="body">Hell, Hollywood hell would not having the show had they never gonna give it to me</p>
<p class="body">I say I tell him all the time, it's I won't know it 'cause I'll be dead before I stop trying for it</p>
<p class="body">Just it would never</p>
<p class="body">I would never know that I will not have all the</p>
<p class="body">Professional accolades my peers</p>
<p class="body">I have</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause I'll be dead 'cause I will always strive to get it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The thing about the Hollywood part is that you you're getting a bunch of people that aren't even comedians to try to give you something true and that</p>
<p class="body">True, I'm glad I escaped that, true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, no I can't</p>
<p class="body">I wish I could</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You can, I think you can</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think you can with this special</p>
<p class="body">I really do</p>
<p class="body">It's that good, but you're that good too</p>
<p class="body">It's it's not like it's just the special it's</p>
<p class="body">There's a few guys like you, Dave Chappelle or Dave Attell</p>
<p class="body">Rather tonewoods, there's a few guys that like they don't get the credit that they deserve, but the performance is there</p>
<p class="body">Which is the hardest part</p>
<p class="body">Like if you are a famous person but you're not good at stand up and then people come to see you</p>
<p class="body">That's not so good</p>
<p class="body">No, that's the opposite of what you want</p>
<p class="body">You're better off being in your position because you've got the product</p>
<p class="body">You've got the, you've got everything, it's just it just needs a vehicle to present it to people and now you have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That let me ask you this, when you see this</p>
<p class="body">Self proclaimed great comic that the industry then put up on there and then you actually go see his act in this</p>
<p class="body">No, I mean it's elementary at best, but just being that, how do you react to it? </p>
<p class="body">Do you tell him or you just say good set, do you? </p>
<p class="body">You know 'cause a lot of volume is outstanding like man stop lying to that man</p>
<p class="body">You know that wasn't outstanding</p>
<p class="body">Say you happy for his success, yeah, but he's not a great comic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There's a few guys that get stuck on shows and when you get stuck on a show or get stuck on and you get famous for a show and then you know your your comedy suffers 'cause you don't have the time but your profile gets elevated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then you start believing the hype and everybody loves you</p>
<p class="body">Anyway, that's one of the things that, like Steve Martin said when he got really famous</p>
<p class="body">He stopped doing stand up because he wasn't getting an honest reaction</p>
<p class="body">They were just so so happy to see him</p>
<p class="body">Steve Martin this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Huge star that they were laughing at everything and you see that sometimes with people they're just happy to see you</p>
<p class="body">And so you don't get this honest reaction, so you you the difference between and</p>
<p class="body">That's what I was jealous about when I was doing fear factor like there was these guys that were just they they didn't have a TV show like I did but they were so good they were so polished and it made me realize like after I was done with fear factor no more that I'm done no more</p>
<p class="body">Now I'm just going to be like fully dedicated to stand up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">In podcasts, so when you decided to do that, how much more did you hit the stage after that constantly? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Constantly much more, much more and much more touring</p>
<p class="body">That's the big one</p>
<p class="body">The big one is the road, you know, Charlie Murphy me and John Heffron did a tour for Bud Light</p>
<p class="body">His real men of comedy tour and we were is the first time I ever did a tour where we did 22 shows in a month. That was like</p>
2007 and we did. 22 show we were we. We would wake up in a hotel room. I don't know</p>
<p class="body">Where the **** I am? </p>
<p class="body">Right there at the ceiling, Ohio</p>
<p class="body">I don't know where I am, I forgot I'd have to look at my phone and we did these shows where we were headlining</p>
<p class="body">Just we would go back and forth like he would headline one</p>
<p class="body">I would headline the other and by the end of the month my **** was so tight right it was just cracking</p>
<p class="body">And I remember I was talking to my friend Brian and he was like, have you ever done this before? </p>
<p class="body">We've done like 22 hour long shows in in a in a month and I said no and he goes man he goes</p>
<p class="body">Your show is so tight everything is so smooth and I go</p>
<p class="body">This is what I got to do</p>
<p class="body">I got to do this all the time</p>
<p class="body">I got to do this all the time</p>
<p class="body">It reinforced 'cause it was right after fear factor it ended</p>
<p class="body">And that's when I started doing that and it made me realize that is it's</p>
<p class="body">There's no substitute for the attention that you give something that the the focus that you give something when you're just fully, completely dedicated to</p>
<p class="body">It yeah, and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">This, if any profession shows who's dedicating who's not</p>
<p class="body">You cannot cheat this right here. The Michael you can have all the accolades and he's on this and he's on that. You'll get that first 5-7 minutes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not even yeah</p>
<p class="body">Well, you got a minute, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Then they, they like come on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now we used to see that at the Comedy Store, a guy would go up and</p>
<p class="body">He was on a sitcom or something</p>
<p class="body">Like that or be like, oh I</p>
<p class="body">Can't believe he's here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh my goodness and</p>
<p class="body">You see 30 seconds</p>
<p class="body">In, they'd be like when is this going to? </p>
<p class="body">Get funny</p>
<p class="body">And then a minute in, they're like what the **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And there's too many funny people on the</p>
<p class="body">Lineup he's got</p>
12 people on that night and you know you better be funny man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Too much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's the great part about comedy</p>
'cause if you better be prepared, I tell comedians all the time</p>
<p class="body">It's not how many followers you got</p>
<p class="body">It's how many comedians you can follow, so you must be able to be able 'cause at some point you're going to be on the same stage where they're able to compare</p>
<p class="body">Now you can go and put that little weak comic in front of you when you had your own show</p>
<p class="body">And then everybody loves you, but eventually</p>
<p class="body">You're gonna come in the pit and when you come in the pit you ain't gonna be the pick your opposition and you're gonna put in the lineup</p>
<p class="body">And based upon your accolades and your profile and your show, he's gonna bump you up to laugh</p>
<p class="body">So we have and you're gonna have to be able to go behind all</p>
<p class="body">Of it, yeah</p>
<p class="body">So that's when you know you are the truth</p>
<p class="body">Specially when you don't have no accolades other than your name</p>
<p class="body">I remember when Cat was the hottest out when American Airlines theater here just flew in to do the Alonzo mourning thing</p>
<p class="body">Steve Harvey was hosting</p>
<p class="body">And I don't know what Cat said, but</p>
<p class="body">You can hear those **** The laughter coming underneath the door and everything</p>
<p class="body">You know, in all the groupie girls is over there and they were like come on man, we can go ahead and go now</p>
'cause katdare golfer we need to go ahead and Steve is like show over here</p>

<p class="body">Oh, ladies and gentlemen, and pets and everything, and 18,000</p>
<p class="body">In the package with the **** 
<p class="body">But as usual, you know, just grab that wave, yeah, wherever he took it from that point on</p>
<p class="body">I don't write long jokes and long setups and got right into it and once you get there and you hit him there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You like ride that ******* way</p>
<p class="body">The key that I noticed when I when I first started I would get nervous going on after someone who was really good and then eventually realized no you should be laughing at them</p>
<p class="body">Should be having fun</p>
<p class="body">You go up there and joining it and ride the wave</p>
<p class="body">Ride the wave but you worry like what if they don't like me as much as they? </p>
<p class="body">Like him, and if you're going to, I went on after Martin Lawrence in the 90s like almost every time I was at the 'cause Mitzi Shore, one of the the great things about Mitzi Shore was she knew how to test you</p>
<p class="body">She knew how</p>
<p class="body">To put you in a bad spot and every time I was on the lineup, if Martin Lawrence was on the lineup</p>
<p class="body">I was going on right now</p>
<p class="body">I was going on right after Martin so Martin would go the whole main room would be sold out</p>
<p class="body">He would murder</p>
<p class="body">This was the leather jumpsuit days</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like Martin would murder like in right? </p>
<p class="body">Wait, I I wanted to quit comedy</p>
<p class="body">I would I</p>
<p class="body">Would go on after him and most of the crowd would leave like 3/4 of the crowd. Would just leave the moment Martin was off stage and then they would bring me up</p>
<p class="body">He would bring me up because you know the the comedy store tag teams</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He would just say my name</p>
<p class="body">This guy is a real funny guy</p>
<p class="body">Give it up for Joe Rogan and I'm like thanks and I just go up and eat **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I learned</p>
<p class="body">How to survive and you learn how to grab people</p>
<p class="body">You learn how to ride the wave and</p>
<p class="body">You learn how to</p>
<p class="body">Grab them because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're going on after a guy who's selling out arenas and he's a movie star and he's got his own television show and</p>
<p class="body">He's just way better than you</p>
<p class="body">There's no if ands or butts about it</p>
<p class="body">You know it</p>
<p class="body">The audience knows it</p>
<p class="body">You gotta figure out a way to elevate you</p>
<p class="body">Gotta rise up and there's no there's no other way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You either rise up or you quit, or you go home</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Or you take that, as with it you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Take that as</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Everybody wants to bring those weak comics on the road with them</p>
<p class="body">That's the that's the worst move</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Ever, Castiel no but you what you're doing is you're giving yourself a self</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>

<p class="body">When I get some money, once you know when I got some money 'cause you won't see me</p>
<p class="body">I'm being honest with you, that's why I now understand</p>
<p class="body">Seeing all these people would say they got all this money</p>
<p class="body">I like the why you working</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">I swear I I can't I</p>
<p class="body">Don't, I don't, I don't, I don't</p>

<p class="body">And don't worry about nothing</p>
<p class="body">That's why I have a perfect mentality for stardom</p>
'cause I don't have to go nowhere</p>
<p class="body">I don't have to be at the after party, right when I say good night, it's good night</p>
<p class="body">When I walk off the stage, I'm gone</p>

<p class="body">It talks a lot of **** 
<p class="body">Of people 
<p class="body">Of it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But those kind of clubs like the Comedy Store or like what I'm going to plan on doing here where you have a lot of people go on at night, I think there's there's a camaraderie to that</p>
<p class="body">There's a thing to that that you don't get when you're just doing the road by yourself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, and then there's a mixture you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean, one thing I do love about the comedy store</p>
<p class="body">They have a lot list of comedians and people come in and they come out</p>
<p class="body">Then having a set show</p>
<p class="body">MC feature</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, just let it rotate</p>
<p class="body">You know you pop in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I like the I like the tag teaming too</p>
<p class="body">Each comic brings up the next comic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I like that too</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's it's beautiful</p>
<p class="body">It's a beautiful way to do it</p>
<p class="body">Mitzi Shore was a ******* genius</p>
<p class="body">She really was</p>
<p class="body">She was a genius</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I liked her she she gave me confidence 'cause I went to audition</p>
<p class="body">You know you could do that</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah can go earthquake earthquake yeah</p>
<p class="body">But she gave it to me 'cause I showed one gonna be known nonpaying regular</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean walking, you know, watching the door to get on stage</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, just</p>
<p class="body">Couldn't take that process</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I was a non paid regular</p>
<p class="body">I was a non paid regular for like six months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah yeah I had kids</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, when you got a woman on your back, everything got to be paid</p>
<p class="body">Ain't such thing the non paid anything you're doing you better bring some money home you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I came to LA in 94. I'd only been doing stand up for like 6 years and I auditioned for Mitzi</p>
<p class="body">She goes wow</p>
<p class="body">You can go on after the show</p>
<p class="body">You can be a non paid regular</p>
<p class="body">And I was</p>
<p class="body">There every night</p>
<p class="body">Every I didn't have any friends</p>
<p class="body">I didn't know anybody</p>
<p class="body">I was on this terrible TV show so I was out there</p>
<p class="body">All I cared about was the comedy store</p>
<p class="body">That's all I was out there 'cause that</p>
<p class="body">Was Mecca when I</p>
<p class="body">Was when I started out in</p>
<p class="body">Boston in 1988</p>
<p class="body">Everybody would talk about the comedy store</p>
<p class="body">That's a comedy store comedy store in Hollywood</p>
<p class="body">That's a Richard Pryor would perform</p>
<p class="body">Sam Kinison would perform dice</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Clay would perform</p>
<p class="body">They're like, whoa</p>
<p class="body">It was like this place that like</p>
<p class="body">A mythical place</p>
<p class="body">I remember the 1st</p>
<p class="body">Time I went there there was like a boat</p>
<p class="body">Act on stage</p>
<p class="body">Like I was like a cruise, it was terrible</p>
<p class="body">Like that was awful</p>
<p class="body">The crowd was half full like this</p>
<p class="body">Is the comedy store</p>

<p class="body">What the **** happened? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Killed your dreams</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it just was a dose of reality because the comedy store goes in these waves and like like in the you know the the 80s</p>
<p class="body">It was prior and he was this massive star and people with all the celebrities that would come to the comedy store to see him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And of course there was always</p>
<p class="body">Robin Williams was there, and David Letterman was there was all these other comedians who were there too, but it was propelled by the gravity of Richard Pryor, right? </p>
<p class="body">And then in the 80s</p>
<p class="body">Later in the 80s it was Kennison</p>
<p class="body">I came in when all that was gone and there was no big comic there</p>
<p class="body">It was no, there was no like one guy, so there's always for whatever reason been a few big name guys and I got in in 90</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There was this lull</p>
<p class="body">Oh so I got to see like these guys that hung around too long and they had the same act for 30 years and they</p>
<p class="body">Were half assing</p>
<p class="body">They were bitter</p>
<p class="body">Right hated young guys like me</p>
<p class="body">They guy</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, come angry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That's what I said, angry, yeah</p>
<p class="body">You're from Boston, yeah, OK? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I was born in New Jersey, but I grew up in Boston</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's where I started doing</p>
<p class="body">Stand up OK, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And you came out there in 94</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I came out to LA 94 because I I gotta, I came out with a sitcom. I was already on a sitcom called Hardball</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Was a baseball sitcom on Fox</p>
<p class="body">Nobody watched it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">But see you</p>
<p class="body">See this what I'm saying came out with a show</p>
<p class="body">Basware man, some of y'all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">He just he just got damn</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I gotta golden horseshoe</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean come on brother, then fear factor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Another show after that called Newsradio</p>

<p class="body">One of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So I'm gonna sit com for five years</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Say, God, that another one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so that I did that sitcom for five years</p>
<p class="body">And then I did fear factor for six years</p>
<p class="body">So it was like Bang Bang bang</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">How did you get fear factor? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Man, I showed up for the audition stoned and because they told me about it I thought it was ridiculous and one of the guys who's the casting agent had cast me on Newsradio so it was still an NBC show and they were trying to do this show and they knew that I had a martial arts background and they thought, well, that would probably be good because this is kind of scary</p>
<p class="body">We're trying to make it scary</p>
<p class="body">I showed up stoned and I was laughing at everything</p>
'cause that was like my getting high everyday stage of life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So I I was there and I was like you're gonna sit</p>
<p class="body">Dogs on people like what the **** 
<p class="body">Is wrong with you and I was laughing like slapping the table in the meeting</p>
<p class="body">I was just making fun of everything and one of the producers like he's not right for the show and the other guy was like listen</p>
<p class="body">If you this is my friend to this day, David Hurwitz, he said, if you don't make fun of this, if he doesn't make fun of this other people going to</p>
<p class="body">Like let him make fun of it like this makes you want</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is a ridiculous show</p>
<p class="body">We're making people eat animal ***** and we're sick and dogs on them like you need a comedian to go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What the **** are we doing? </p>
<p class="body">And so that's how I got it</p>

<p class="body">They had a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Totally different idea</p>
<p class="body">Before I came in, they wanted someone to fear is definitely a factor for you</p>
<p class="body">They wanted like a sports broadcaster they wanted, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Man, yeah, well the monotone is radio dudes, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Exactly, they wanted someone who was like cookie cutter and they figured like I had a name</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">I was on a sitcom, you know</p>
<p class="body">It was like this would work</p>
<p class="body">I've already been on NBC for five years</p>
<p class="body">This would be a good transition</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">See see how being you now everybody else that walked in that moment took advice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">This is how you should get it</p>
<p class="body">Notes you understand directions and this is what they're looking for and you took your HIAS in there</p>
<p class="body">It's a ****** yeah and got the job, that's what I mean</p>
<p class="body">And it's it's it that's</p>
<p class="body">And if anybody listening to me, especially comedian that is the key</p>
<p class="body">You have to be, you just just be you</p>
<p class="body">Got it, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Can't nobody tell you else how to be you and it took me awhile to do that because you know when I tell people I don't write I wait you should write and rehearse this way I said man it comes out already</p>
<p class="body">Just turn the mic on, let me do and it kills me with what's your first truck? </p>
<p class="body">Could it be? </p>
<p class="body">What's your second job gonna be listen? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">But I will stop in seven minutes</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if I can't cuss</p>
<p class="body">I won't cuss, but I will stop in seven minutes</p>
<p class="body">If 7 minutes is delaudid time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You do it right for you</p>
<p class="body">That's you being you</p>
<p class="body">Some guys have to arrive, right? </p>
<p class="body">Uh, right</p>
<p class="body">And then I I do ********** too on stage</p>
<p class="body">But I sit down in front of my computer and I write and some bits come to me from that that I never would</p>
<p class="body">Have got any other way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then I still have to **** around on stage two</p>
<p class="body">I have to</p>
<p class="body">Do all of them, but some guys</p>
<p class="body">Their whole thing is written</p>
<p class="body">George Carlin used to write every ******* word he said</p>
<p class="body">Everything was written out</p>
<p class="body">He would write like a monologue, and then he</p>
<p class="body">Would punch it up, yeah, I believe</p>
<p class="body">Jay-Z apparently doesn't write any of his lyrics, keeps him on his head</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, it's Bill Burr</p>
<p class="body">Bill Burr doesn't write, he just he he comes up with bits works on them</p>
<p class="body">He'll he'll make like a set list</p>
<p class="body">Maybe should he's going to do, but it's all in his head</p>
<p class="body">He's all just constantly working on it in his head</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and he's one of the best alive</p>
<p class="body">It's the whole thing is, it's depending on who you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Are yeah, what's right for you, it's right for you</p>
<p class="body">There is no right way</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the result is the right way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's just hard to be yourself, you know</p>
<p class="body">And when the fear factor thing I was only myself because I didn't</p>
<p class="body">Give a **** 
<p class="body">I didn't think it was going anywhere and I had a development deal</p>
<p class="body">So I was</p>
<p class="body">Like what do</p>
<p class="body">You want me to do like what the **** is this 'cause I wanted to do another sitcom and then they came with this and I was</p>
<p class="body">Like this is even better because now I don't have to work with actors</p>
<p class="body">I mean, this would be so much better</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause working with actors is I got lucky with Newsradio 'cause it was a really talented cast and they were fun people</p>
<p class="body">But I had done some other **** with people with their fake and it's a nightmare and you got to play the game and they're all reading The Hollywood Reporter and variety every day</p>
<p class="body">I'm like I'm not like you people and I can't wait to go to the comedy store tonight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">At all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm just here because you're going to give me a lot of money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">In a dim sum of the most insecure people in the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">World, they're so weird</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, they're weird</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's so fake</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That's why I will never ever</p>
<p class="body">Could marry an actress</p>
<p class="body">I never believe I love</p>
<p class="body">You with all my</p>
<p class="body">Heart, you know you baby you important to me, saying</p>
<p class="body">You know what I'm saying? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it just nothing is and I really think, especially when they do this method</p>
<p class="body">I 'cause I said why are you doing all this studying? </p>
<p class="body">Being somebody else who's developing you during that time, why you sitting here playing this actor is doing all the the different nuances of this person doing all these but just acting them for months and months being whose developing you at that time? </p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Do you just stop your growth at this point? </p>
<p class="body">Say, **** it</p>
<p class="body">I'm already reached the potential I want myself</p>
<p class="body">Let me go play this mother for awhile</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know crazy person to be really good at it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But some of them aren't like</p>
<p class="body">I've met actors and actresses that are cool as **** that are real, normal and real friendly</p>
<p class="body">But it's just not worth the risk</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the risk is you 8 out of 10 or</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Crazy crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, there's some of them that are great people</p>
<p class="body">They're really nice and normal</p>
<p class="body">They just love acting</p>
<p class="body">They love being able to pretend that you're a different person, just just dive into the role and become that you know you got</p>
<p class="body">These people that can do that</p>
<p class="body">They transform themselves with each movie</p>
<p class="body">They're a different person through</p>
<p class="body">That's a real craft, yeah, but eight out of 10 of them are just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Crazy people believe it's don't, they grow</p>
<p class="body">And at one point I'd be like God Dam</p>
<p class="body">Who am I talking to you or? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">URL that you played last week</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean</p>
<p class="body">So you you sit back on it I I just can't deal with actors just that way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, especially with what we do, which is you try so hard to be authentic like the whole thing is</p>
<p class="body">Avoid anything that takes you out of being authentic, and with that is is the exact opposite. It's like you have to pretend you're this dude who lives in like Virginia in 1600 and you're you're you're talking in that dialect when you're ordering food</p>
<p class="body">Exactly like you won't break character like what are you doing man</p>
<p class="body">No one talks like that anymore</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Don't call me my name is King Earl</p>
<p class="body">Don't call me a teen girl</p>
<p class="body">Have your kids call it's just too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">People that get in the character and they stay in the character for days and days</p>
<p class="body">I remember I was reading this article where Jon Voight, you know the famous actor</p>
<p class="body">He's the father of Angelina Jolie</p>
<p class="body">True and John Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight would talk on the phone in character</p>
<p class="body">That's how they have</p>
<p class="body">I'm like I'm out I'm I'm out I'm out if my daughter ever talked to me on the phone in character, I drive over to her house like what the **** is wrong with? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That's it may be asking too much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You I'm your dad</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to hear about this fake Debbie Lady</p>
<p class="body">You play from Brooklyn I wanna talk to you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">This is Debbie dad</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm Debbie, dad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Debbie dot this is I am today</p>
<p class="body">Yeah now **** you, you're my daughter talk normal yeah? </p>
<p class="body">It's I mean, but again, I mean, I wouldn't say they're all nuts 'cause I've met a lot of them that are very sincere</p>
<p class="body">They're not nice people</p>
<p class="body">But it's just not worth the risk at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And then, especially in the the real one, is is the acting coaches want you go deep down and grab that feeling when you was miss you was treated wrong</p>
<p class="body">And remember that and translate that into the character</p>
<p class="body">Don't forget I wanna open up these doors</p>
<p class="body">One of these dolls, ********** beyond some hair on</p>
<p class="body">By Friday I found out my father really didn't love me</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">No, I'm good</p>
<p class="body">I'm a functional adult and I can deal with everything</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to know nothing else</p>
<p class="body">I don't wanna know what circumstances my mother did to give me away</p>
<p class="body">I don't wanna know why she did none of that</p>
<p class="body">I am good</p>
<p class="body">OK I sleep well at night I am good with</p>
<p class="body">My, I know</p>
<p class="body">We got to find that pain and translate that pain into the character and that way is authentic</p>
<p class="body">I said if I can't just play like I'm crying without remembering when something really hurt me, I'm not your guy</p>
<p class="body">I am not your ******* guy and again I am not an actor</p>
<p class="body">I'm a movie star</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, this is difference</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, OK, so we're not going down that way</p>
<p class="body">No you, that's the way it is</p>
<p class="body">Is it started from the tree from the teaching of those of acting coaches 'cause they asked you that all the time go deep</p>
<p class="body">I remember I had to fire acting coach over that</p>
<p class="body">You're not going into deep</p>
<p class="body">OK, let's sit down and just talk about the most painful thing ever happened to you in your life</p>
<p class="body">And that way, if you can tap into that, you can bring this character to life. I said, listen lady, I see my I don't waste my $55 here</p>
'cause I will not be here tomorrow</p>
<p class="body">With this kind of</p>
**** at all, specially when you could</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Be a comic like that was my take like I remember I was on the set of Newsradio once and one of the guys who was a producer said, why do you still do comedy? </p>
<p class="body">You're an actor now</p>
<p class="body">And when he said that I was like, Oh my God, I gotta get the **** out of here</p>
<p class="body">I'm like I gotta get out of here like you guys are out of your ******* mind do</p>

<p class="body">You know how? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Much better comedy is than this</p>
<p class="body">Even though this was comedy, 'cause it was a sitcom, but there's no ******* comparison</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Not at all</p>
<p class="body">Everybody would look forward</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">To the laughs that they would get when they would perform a scene in front of the crowd</p>
<p class="body">Everybody wanted to get a good laugh</p>
<p class="body">My guy did that every night</p>
<p class="body">I do it every night I I don't have to deal with the actor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Goodnight 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't have to deal</p>
<p class="body">With a producer or</p>
<p class="body">A director is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Just me true and I get the bigger and my results are bigger than yours</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot bigger</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And bigger and</p>
<p class="body">You could ride them and you could **** around and do different things with it</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to like cut that's not in the script</p>
<p class="body">Like it's it's free, you're free</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And very free</p>
<p class="body">Let me ask you something</p>
<p class="body">When he was a comedian did they surround you with? </p>
<p class="body">Establish actors and just allow you to play off of them or you had to conform to being an actor as an acting comedian</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, luckily on Newsradio the producers were brilliant and they wanted us to adlib</p>
<p class="body">They wanted us so there was Dave Foley who's from the kids in the hall, the sketch show and Dave</p>
<p class="body">Was like one of the secret producers of the show, really 'cause he was the star of the show, but he was really like producing scenes so we would rehearse and he would come up with completely new lines for things</p>
<p class="body">And if you had a line that was better than the line that was in the script they wanted you to say that</p>
<p class="body">So they wanted you</p>
<p class="body">They wanted it to be collaborative where you would come up with the best **** So there was fun in that and we would write jokes for each other and we would **** around with with each other</p>
<p class="body">So it was</p>
<p class="body">It was very fortunate that that particular job was, you know, it was it was OK</p>
<p class="body">You could **** around</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm laughing Joe 'cause you had a great life man, let me check</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's lucky</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Very lucky, blessed, lucky</p>
<p class="body">Whatever adjective you want, but that's a great life to have a person in a position to understand your strength and allow you to utilize it</p>
<p class="body">You have so many people</p>
<p class="body">You can't change the actor</p>
<p class="body">The writers words</p>
<p class="body">That's all his birds</p>
<p class="body">And I'm looking in fact this **** is corny</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's good</p>
<p class="body">You hired me 'cause you said me right, but you want me to say something that I wouldn't say exactly or say it like that</p>
<p class="body">But like the checks say this</p>
<p class="body">Come on down here little arrow</p>
<p class="body">Come on down here, little girl</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I did that for the first show</p>
<p class="body">That sitcom that I did though the baseball show that was terrible and that was I learned a lot from that, because that was terrible that it started out great</p>
<p class="body">The guys who wrote it, they wrote on married with children and the symptoms they're really good writers and they were really funny guys and they put together this pilot</p>
<p class="body">And Jim Breuer was in the pilot with me and it was a very funny pilot</p>
<p class="body">But then once it got on television Fox decided to hire some dude who was a producer of that show coach and like all cookie cutter type, stand up or sitcom writing and they brought in a bunch of hacks and they they ******** the show</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it was terrible</p>
<p class="body">Like I I remember saying lines like I can't believe this is a line on a ******* sitcom</p>
<p class="body">It was just not good and it got and they were talented people on the show, but it was just a bad show and then</p>
<p class="body">It got cancelled and so to</p>
<p class="body">Go from that to Newsradio, which was the opposite</p>
<p class="body">Working with Phil Hartman and all these like seriously talented people</p>
<p class="body">Steven Rude, Maura Tierney, and</p>
<p class="body">Candy Alexander Vicki Lewis it's like Andy **** is like this is a great show like holy **** It was like I can't believe how good everybody is and then there was a freedom to **** around so I had the the worst case scenario and then followed by the best case scenario</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, I mean, you've been very fortunate on that because all my scenarios were ******** I'm just</p>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it is you just read it</p>
<p class="body">You be like God dam</p>
<p class="body">Who wrote this, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Give me a little leeway on it, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A comic that has to do bad lines in a sitcom is in Hell</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Hell hell what his name</p>
<p class="body">He told me this</p>
<p class="body">Off of Seinfeld, Richard was just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like Michael, Richard, Michael</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Rich is</p>
<p class="body">He said quake, you're gonna be on the show you're gonna have your own show but I want you to remember one thing whatever show you do</p>
<p class="body">You're gonna be on there</p>
<p class="body">You're committing five years of your life if it's gonna be successful, you wanna go there and get the same joy that you do on stage</p>
<p class="body">That and I kept it</p>
<p class="body">So when now when I make decision I like do I see myself doing this for five years</p>
<p class="body">No, OK, I don't want to play this role</p>
<p class="body">For five years, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a good mindset, yeah, because you</p>
<p class="body">We all know those guys who get on a show that sucks and they they just take the money</p>
<p class="body">They just all they want to do is buy things</p>
<p class="body">They just want to like, give themselves little rewards like they</p>
<p class="body">They're always unhappy</p>
<p class="body">They're like I can't wait to buy a new jacket or a new car</p>
<p class="body">A new this where they're always just concentrating on the rewards that they get</p>
<p class="body">Rather than the reward they get from the actual work</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean because</p>
<p class="body">To be honest with, you need something to justify this hell that you in yeah, you know what I mean? </p>
'cause you inhale, you could look at some sets and you were like I would love to be in that you can look at like Martin</p>
<p class="body">You could tell that was a great place to go to work</p>
<p class="body">Living Color was a great place to go to work</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Wasn't work</p>
<p class="body">We was all friends coming up with some **** and we just</p>
<p class="body">Put it on tape, that's what</p>
<p class="body">You want, that's what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but those are hard to get</p>
<p class="body">Those are and one of the worst things that happens is some of the guys that get those sitcoms that are ****** is they can't do standup anymore</p>
'cause they're worried that if they do stand up and they and people find out that they're dirty or they they said something crazy, then they'll get fired from the show</p>
<p class="body">Oh right, there's a lot of guys that like how to stop doing stand up while they got a sitcom</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Because, and I strongly believe this, that's why a lot of lose their fans see</p>
<p class="body">Prime example, whatever show that I do is going to be the biggest show for most of my audience to see me, so that's going to be their interpretation</p>
<p class="body">Who I am, so I must</p>
<p class="body">Portray who I am in my first venture on TV so I can bring my fans who sees me who already been fans about and they can recognize me in that and then the people who just see me for the first time could come see me on stand up and say, OK, that's who I got</p>
<p class="body">A lot of comedians like</p>
<p class="body">Come like my boy, Mark Curry had his show</p>
<p class="body">Yeah they Mr</p>
<p class="body">Cooper yeah Mr</p>
<p class="body">Cooper good dude man and then they go see Mr</p>
<p class="body">He's from Oakland CA</p>
<p class="body">Yeah these ******* in these holding Oh my God Mr</p>

<p class="body">What are you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Talking about man, you eliminate it</p>
<p class="body">The people who like Mr</p>
<p class="body">Cooper, right and the people who supported you and use the custom in the comedian see you playing Mr</p>
<p class="body">Cooper like that ain't the marquino right? </p>
<p class="body">You see what I'm saying so you don't get the transfer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Most comedians who blow I have learned this long time play themselves in their first major production, so they bring</p>
<p class="body">Their current friend and the spine that expand their base and their brand bigger in on Martin playing Martin Steve Harvey, playing Steve Harvey Cat playing cat</p>
<p class="body">Eddie Murphy being Eddie Murphy</p>
<p class="body">All of them that blown that now all the comedians that did other things and went into as a character actor or comedy and didn't do bring their stand up with them</p>
<p class="body">What they was known for died</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Burnt and hail, and the way they, because they alienated both</p>
<p class="body">They alienated the people who support him</p>
<p class="body">They give him that point and then when they got to that point, the people who just saw him for the first time wanted to go see him do stand up and was insulted</p>
<p class="body">It's like it's the Urkel rule</p>
<p class="body">No matter what Urkel do, he's always going to be Urkel</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I love Julia</p>
<p class="body">He can be anything but you're gonna see me circle 'cause that was the first person that was the 1st</p>
<p class="body">He was introduced through as Urkel and people always going to see him as Urkel</p>
<p class="body">Now if he was a comedian he will never work again</p>
<p class="body">Because if he was a stand up comedian doing all that like no, that that ain't Urkel</p>
<p class="body">And if you supported him like why you out here selling out playing this dude like this ain't that hard</p>
<p class="body">My life articles Janelle, smoke, herb hang out he's a real ************ 

<p class="body">Right? </p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes yes no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>

<p class="body">Cooper, which is like a very family easysoft show like a nice show</p>
<p class="body">Nice guy but you watch Mark Curry on stage</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean if you go to see him live, you still see wild comedy, you know. But but Damon's in that sort of big money sitcom world where they keep giving him these shows where he's the star of a show. And he's like a dad and he's like</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, well, that's Jerry Seinfeld</p>
<p class="body">I'm right, George Carlin did it</p>
<p class="body">I'm like, well he</p>
<p class="body">They probably needed the money</p>
<p class="body">They probably well Jerry didn't, but maybe they did it because they thought that was a good way to do it</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it's a good way to do it for me</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you have like a set of stories that you want to get out? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably as I reflect I'm a today person</p>
<p class="body">I live in the moment so yesterday is gone and then you could do it in anything she could do for me</p>
<p class="body">It's like a woman that's gone, so I will have to sit back and reflect and usually for me to do it I will</p>
<p class="body">Build friends that made that ride with me, so as they remind me yeah yeah, yeah that they have put that in there</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Record it well</p>
<p class="body">I have a literary person that does a lot of books that also work for me and in my comedy club</p>
<p class="body">So she's been trying to get me to do it for the longest, and now that it's coming to fruition</p>
<p class="body">I'm uh, allowed her to be the point person on it, and I supplied the stories and she had read it all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Up so you're already in motion with this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">No, we talked about it</p>
<p class="body">We've been talking about it for the last three or four years</p>
<p class="body">I said I would do it when the opportunity presents itself</p>
<p class="body">See, I'm not that kind of person that round here</p>
<p class="body">I'm not a supermarket type dude. Please you know the test. Try this please. What you do this? This is tide 2% two Oz. Try it if you like it you can come over here and get the whole thing I'm not</p>

<p class="body">They played with me and so now we just out here and see what we're going to do</p>
<p class="body">I would like to have a network television show</p>
<p class="body">I would like to</p>
<p class="body">I, me and Darnell is starting in my first lead in the movie, so we got that one done</p>
<p class="body">What would that it's called? </p>
<p class="body">Bed written it's about a dude who's a very arrogant womanizer</p>
<p class="body">And finally you know comma</p>
<p class="body">Catch up with him and he's a temporary paralyzed and he's bedridden and he's losing this company and why he's at the same time and see how bad he did inflict pain to his wife and his kids</p>
<p class="body">And those type of things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh wow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And Donnell plays my brother on it, you know</p>
<p class="body">And we did that and we did an independent movie together for that</p>
<p class="body">And I want to do more of that and my own sitcom around my life, that kind of thing where I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">At now, so around your life as a stand up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, Oh yeah, about to blow</p>
<p class="body">And then I finally blow and now the kids that I couldn't get to see now they came and visit me and never left</p>
<p class="body">Now they living with me</p>
<p class="body">Yeah that type of thing, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So you've been thinking about this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">For a while, yeah, we was in development for we got all the way up to the President of CBS</p>
<p class="body">But unfortunately he didn't see our</p>
<p class="body">View on it, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a gamble, you know</p>
<p class="body">They have like 30 shows and they have</p>
<p class="body">Like 4 slots</p>
<p class="body">And so they like have to like</p>
<p class="body">I've been in that developmental process</p>
<p class="body">It's a strange process when they're trying to figure out what's going to work and</p>
<p class="body">What's not going to work? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, I get that too, but to give an honest shot, if you're gonna give it to you</p>
<p class="body">These guys shoot a pilot to see what you got</p>
<p class="body">I don't think you can sit down and say if it's good like you just said you can't tell if it's funny just off the paper</p>
<p class="body">No you have</p>
<p class="body">To sit here and dumb players involved and then look at it and say this is what you got</p>
<p class="body">If you honestly say that you're trying to give a show</p>
<p class="body">And definitely if you say you're trying to have diversity on CBS, yeah, I have to at some point</p>
<p class="body">Allow you know the actors to put it on a or invest enough to see what you got tested and see is it</p>
<p class="body">I understand the four slots, but if you're going to sit here and say you trying to do diversity on with the NAACP opposed to be a slot there already posed to be one there, or at least opportunity for it</p>
<p class="body">Right, you know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">So that's the that's when I come in advantage</p>
<p class="body">I I never want to be anywhere that no one wants me to be, but at some point in this game that we're doing you, if you, if you're not familiar with</p>
<p class="body">With the</p>
<p class="body">The the creative aspect of certain people</p>
<p class="body">You have to least see it and let someone else see Ken this work</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">That's where it is</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I don't think anything should be killed just on the paper right there without you investing in the point to see it, especially if you was part</p>
<p class="body">Of writing it itself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And you were happy with the script and</p>
<p class="body">How it came? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Out, yeah</p>
<p class="body">I mean we, we got like writeups from the President of the network notes on it on the script and everything</p>
<p class="body">And then when it came to the point of</p>
<p class="body">They said they passed up on it, then it was shocking to me to the point that we didn't even get the chance to even</p>
<p class="body">Shoot the pallet for it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sometimes it's like a bunch of **** like the people that are producing it</p>
<p class="body">They don't have a good deal with the network or you know, like sometimes the network wants to produce and own their own shows</p>
<p class="body">And maybe Warner Brothers will come to CBS or something they like it</p>
<p class="body">Warner Brothers owns it, so they don't want Warner Brothers to make a **** load of money and CBS has their own show they would rather take that even if it's not as good</p>
<p class="body">There was a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Lot of that MVC yeah, but we was on we was coming out of CBS Studios 2 CBS on there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Also, there's no Siemens</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">The writer had a deal already with CBS, the writer, and I'm already on CBS</p>
<p class="body">About working on the neighborhood so everything was in hours</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">And then we did announcement, you know, saying that it was part of the NAACP diversity to to put more on it</p>
<p class="body">So I was shocked about that</p>
<p class="body">To be quite honest with you and you know we're going to see what we're going to do with it</p>
'cause we're still on here, but I do want to have</p>
<p class="body">TV show and</p>
<p class="body">Might end up being on Netflix</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So is</p>
<p class="body">The last the past pilot season like just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">This this happened</p>
<p class="body">This happened about a week ago</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, that's why you're hot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I was just noting, yeah, so I'm not</p>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<p class="body">You know, I mean, I just don't understand the process if you sing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I get it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">You want to include</p>
<p class="body">If you don't, then don't you know what I'm saying? </p>
<p class="body">If you have a, if you have a, uh, can I put this? </p>
<p class="body">If you have a demographic that's happy where it is and you don't want to, God bless you</p>
<p class="body">But don't come over here, it's it's equivalent to say, hey, I do country music</p>
<p class="body">But country music good, but I want some R&B on here. I want you to come over here and play. Put some R&B song on our station. Like alright, I submit the song to you and you sit down here and you go to work now and people don't wanna hit that. Don't hear that and we we we reconstruct the whole song around after three or four</p>
<p class="body">Rewrites of my song on it</p>
<p class="body">And then I said, OK, when we go to the studio and cut the the song and they said Nah? </p>
<p class="body">We don't like the song</p>
<p class="body">You wrote them on fuc? </p>
<p class="body">I thought you said she wanted it on here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You have an opportunity to do the Netflix 'cause I, I think that's the best place</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">I mean, when you know the deal, we couldn't go nowhere else while we was doing it with them, we thought we was there with them so we didn't get a chance</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right so, but now you're free? </p>
<p class="body">Are you free, is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know what my situation is right now, it's just it's fresh off of it</p>
<p class="body">I just it just happened this Friday</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And no</p>
<p class="body">Commercials, true commercials or ******** 
<p class="body">I know they're brutal</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, they when you watch these sitcoms and they have to cut everything into these little chunks</p>
<p class="body">So that fits perfectly inside of a network break</p>
<p class="body">It just doesn't work good</p>
<p class="body">It's not fun</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">And then you have to sit there and watch the commercial and wait for it to come on or you record it in advance</p>
<p class="body">You have to Fast forward through it</p>
<p class="body">With Netflix you film the whole season, you watch it all in one sitting</p>
<p class="body">If you want, you can binge watch it</p>
<p class="body">You can pause it, but go take a</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
**** come back</p>
<p class="body">Start it up again</p>
<p class="body">You know it's like it's a better format, it's just better</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's better because it's uncensored</p>
<p class="body">It's better because the programming on Netflix is better</p>
<p class="body">You know we were talking</p>
<p class="body">About Ozark before the the</p>
<p class="body">Podcast *** **** that's a good show</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">My friend Eric is the producer</p>
<p class="body">Creative yeah, yeah, he he wants to do something with it but I I want to take anywhere that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, really</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">They want us any way you</p>
<p class="body">Want it wherever you want it</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Wherever you wanted to allow me to be me I have no problem with any</p>
<p class="body">Any format do you right? </p>
<p class="body">But if you're going to come and say you want to do us and you want me to do us, then allow me to be me and and and the go she ate</p>
<p class="body">OK Missy, negotiate, but if it is if this is what you want then come in in all good faith, that's all</p>
<p class="body">I get it</p>
<p class="body">It's for me</p>
<p class="body">You know, and it was it was</p>
<p class="body">It was very disappointing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I understand</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Very disappointing</p>
<p class="body">It was very disappointing</p>
<p class="body">Like a lot and we all been through 'cause I think Dave then had more ******* development deals than anybody in their life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, he's a lot</p>
<p class="body">Yeah shitloads, it's just free money</p>
<p class="body">A lot of times free money and meetings</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well we get no money either</p>
<p class="body">Definitely no</p>
<p class="body">No money, no way no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They didn't give you money for the development</p>
<p class="body">Deal for to to put together sick</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we ain't no we ain't got no money</p>
<p class="body">The money that's like</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you know money people so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They don't do that anymore</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Tell you just sit sit here</p>
<p class="body">Thank you for your **** you know, but you ain't</p>
<p class="body">No money and you're talking about 5-6 months and once you're in, negotiate with them. Of course, you can't go nobody else. 'cause you're saying, hey man, I'm I'm ahead this</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Six months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, six months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And they dangle that carrot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, they dangled that</p>

<p class="body">It's done</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
********** I've around this business knew I was</p>
<p class="body">Going I was like winning the Super Bowl</p>
<p class="body">Gonna be on CBS 'cause I'm gonna</p>
<p class="body">Be on that ************* I</p>
<p class="body">Can't wait until they give me the plug and the teaser quake house today 8:00 o'clock on CBS</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't know if it's called me up or</p>
<p class="body">They get bored</p>
<p class="body">They give you that car</p>
<p class="body">That's the worst call in the world though</p>
<p class="body">They found out they want to go another way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">My mother</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, like well</p>
<p class="body">Without even seeing it, I think you ain't invested enough to even do a pallet to see the play it</p>
<p class="body">I mean come on man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But that's the problem that I always had with Hollywood is you have to be chosen, and that's one of the things that makes people so crazy like some people don't have the mental fortitude to withstand that kind of rejection over and over and over again or disappointment</p>
<p class="body">And like if you think about what like, especially with actors, you get a bunch of people that are insecure that are</p>
<p class="body">Kind of crazy to begin with</p>
<p class="body">And then they go to this place where they're they're asking you to pretend in this moment</p>
<p class="body">Like OK Quake, you're going to sit down with Mike and Mike is going to play Sally, so there's a guy pretending to play your wife and you're you're running through the scene with this person like</p>
<p class="body">OK, well thank you</p>
<p class="body">We'll be in touch and then you leave, you know</p>
<p class="body">Like I don't even know how that was</p>
<p class="body">And like it it and you got you have to be chosen so you so you start to see people</p>
<p class="body">Behaving in a way that they think the casting agent would like, saying the kind of things they think the casting agent wants to hear</p>
<p class="body">It's true they did</p>
<p class="body">They adopt the politics of the casting agents</p>
<p class="body">You know they'll say something about a current event thing like my heavens, like why are we even doing this? </p>
<p class="body">I'm like</p>
<p class="body">Yes, why aren't we doing this thing? </p>
<p class="body">Thank you Joe</p>
<p class="body">We agree with you, but you you feel like a ***** ** **** when you're, you're getting a cup of coffee</p>
<p class="body">She was like what the **** is wrong with? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Me, I'm a hor my my lips are chapped</p>
<p class="body">I kiss trying to get this this show man</p>
<p class="body">I mean it was but you know, I never</p>
<p class="body">Take it personally</p>
'cause again, like my mother said, you can't get mad at somebody that ain't gonna let you **** with a **** Yeah, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Know what I? </p>
<p class="body">It's in people ask me all the time you know</p>
<p class="body">Like Quake, my fans say it to me quake you're the funniest man ******* with why you got no TV show why you ain't got no movies I said hey, like I turned the ship down right ain't like</p>
<p class="body">I said hey, yeah</p>
<p class="body">I want to be on CBS</p>
<p class="body">I'd rather be in Lakeland, FL or somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">And it is, but it's subjective</p>
<p class="body">What's funny to somebody is not funny to another, so I always the way I took it is that I just haven't made the right person laugh yet who they will believe in me</p>
<p class="body">To sit here and give me the opportunities that my peers didn't have, yeah, and until I break that person who believes in me</p>
<p class="body">That sees that I am a valuable commodity that could do both me and them a great service and what they say they're here to make entertainment and TV shows</p>
<p class="body">Then I will always be sitting at the door with this ******** and it it it will, you know</p>
<p class="body">And I don't even take it personally</p>
<p class="body">Man, I'm so ******* used to it</p>
<p class="body">I try not</p>
<p class="body">To put myself out there, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you feel the pain so you don't feel the pain, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause disappointment is the worst thing for me</p>
<p class="body">Have it yeah, then to be disappointed</p>
<p class="body">I rather not</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">So in the future, the next one that I do, unless they come to me and say, hey, we're going to put you to serve this where we get, but it ain't gonna no more stringing along</p>
<p class="body">You're not going to be sitting around here with we together and then give me a call at 12:00 o'clock on Friday night and say no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">When you've been doing it as</p>
<p class="body">Long as you have to</p>
<p class="body">It's like and you develop an audience the way you have</p>
<p class="body">It's like you don't wanna **** with that anymore, but you're always wanting that thing that you didn't have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, but it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's to me to be honest with you, it's just expanding what I am already is</p>
<p class="body">I hope people attention for hour. I know I can do it with 22 minutes with a lot of people playing in the 5th tissues</p>
<p class="body">World and on it come on *** **** and</p>
<p class="body">It shows that it worked, that's why you have so many reality shows us killing your scripted shows</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, because your fictitious world you bringing up don't nobody buy this</p>
<p class="body">You understand what I'm saying? </p>
<p class="body">Don't buy it so, and definitely if you don't know about that world, you least have to see it</p>
<p class="body">So you can see it tested as a CEO of anything</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, to expand your own brand</p>
<p class="body">If I if I owned a record label and I'm I, I want some country singers, I'm gonna get somebody know about country singers and and I'm like is that good? </p>
<p class="body">OK, that's good</p>
<p class="body">When I own a comedy club, I used to tell people all the time</p>
<p class="body">I don't book the comedians, the crowd do</p>
<p class="body">It's not my job to find</p>
<p class="body">Is he funny or not? </p>
<p class="body">Do he pull the people in and they laugh? </p>
<p class="body">Then that's what it</p>
<p class="body">Is how I feel is in relevant? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, if I I would prefer my friend to be up here</p>
<p class="body">But if my friend is only bringing 10 people and shucky ducky is bringing 200 shucky, ducky, quack, quack is coming on through here</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, regardless if I think my friend is funny</p>
<p class="body">This Chucky ducky? </p>
<p class="body">Because I have to sit here and make a decision based upon what the fans and what the consumer</p>
<p class="body">And you have to evolve</p>
<p class="body">That's the great thing I say about rap is they always had a person like? </p>
<p class="body">Uhm, Russell Simmons</p>
<p class="body">Pick Pete Diddy puffy</p>
<p class="body">They was able to talk to the radio</p>
<p class="body">The record labels say Listen we got what you need</p>
<p class="body">Don't come down here, mess with our artists, right? </p>
'cause you'll never understand it right</p>
<p class="body">Even trust me</p>
<p class="body">Give me the money and I'll bring you back the results, yeah, but don't you come into the record</p>
<p class="body">Lose, don't you come in the booth and say he shouldn't say that that ain't how it is you don't understand do you wanna win or you don't want to win? </p>
<p class="body">We in comedy has never had a puffy</p>
<p class="body">We have never had a Russell Simmons</p>
<p class="body">We had a Walter Latham and he did the kings of comedy in Harlem Brothers came out and became stars but he got upset 'cause he think he posed to go father with him</p>
<p class="body">So he never did a king of comedies 234 and five. He just shut the **** down and then let nobody else play King put king on nothing else no more</p>
<p class="body">He came back with another tour and called it the Walter Latham presents</p>
<p class="body">I was on it and I was like present</p>
<p class="body">What nobody know you</p>
<p class="body">Nobody know you, man</p>
<p class="body">Don't know you should call this King of comedy to write with already had brand recognition so we could continue on but you still mad at them, brothers, 'cause they elevated and didn't go that way</p>
<p class="body">So what you gonna do? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So all the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">People, no, because we never had a person didn't want to be</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's so good</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think Netflix opens a door</p>
<p class="body">That's what I think I think that's the smart thing to do because like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This special is going to be killer and then you having a sitcom on Netflix is natural</p>
<p class="body">That's easy</p>
<p class="body">It's better</p>
<p class="body">It's better, it'll be real</p>
<p class="body">You could say whatever the **** you want, they'll let you **** around like Netflix leaves you the **** alone when you do a special it's it's beautiful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I've I've done two specials with that three</p>
<p class="body">Specials with them</p>
<p class="body">They just leave you the **** alone</p>
<p class="body">They never say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Anything to me and they take care of you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, they say carrier</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I ain't got no moment I ain't got no Monique problem</p>
<p class="body">Over here, yeah</p>
<p class="body">It was good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They take care of you and they leave you alone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, they take care of me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They leave you alone, they just like they trust that you're funny</p>
<p class="body">They go when you going to</p>
<p class="body">When are you going to record it? </p>
<p class="body">OK, we'll go</p>
<p class="body">Watch they'll</p>
<p class="body">They're there to watch and then like when is it going to be delivered? </p>
<p class="body">September perfect? </p>
<p class="body">OK, it'll it'll errand, phucking, November or whatever it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And and it's nothing, they don't</p>
<p class="body">There's no involvement in the creative process which is beautiful 'cause I had to deal with Comedy Central and I they had to make a transcript to my set</p>
<p class="body">And then I had a phone call with them and and the phone call the transcript</p>
<p class="body">They go</p>
<p class="body">Well, you can't say that they got</p>
<p class="body">They got to the third</p>
<p class="body">You can't say that I go stop</p>
<p class="body">I'm good, I'm done</p>
<p class="body">I quit and they're like what I go</p>
<p class="body">I'm not doing this</p>
<p class="body">I'm not doing this with you guys like I'm not doing this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm like this is not happening</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Eventually went on to do one a couple years later but but there was no problem with that material back then</p>
<p class="body">They had kind of changed when streaming came along too, because they realized that kind of had to open up the content a little bit more</p>
<p class="body">Because they were losing comics, they're losing people to Netflix and losing people to HBO and Showtime, and places where you could just be free</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you feel that Netflix? </p>
<p class="body">Is what HBO used to be with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Bigger, bigger, bigger</p>
<p class="body">It's bigger than HBO with HBO was was there was only HBO</p>
<p class="body">The thing about HBO is it's still around like there's still guys who do HBO specials and they're still great, but what Netflix is is you could watch any ******* time you want</p>
<p class="body">You watch on your phone</p>
<p class="body">You could watch it</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I know that HBO has HBO</p>
<p class="body">What is it? </p>
<p class="body">It's long, it's great</p>
<p class="body">Is it Netflix? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Now it's a beast and it's global, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's global, it's a juggernaut</p>
<p class="body">You can't stop it, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That what Dave told me he's like man, you don't even understand</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you're gonna be raking in money I say please let that go</p>
<p class="body">Jesus, it's easy for you to say</p>
<p class="body">Why you sitting on? </p>
<p class="body">It, but please let it come</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, a guy like you, one of the beautiful things is you</p>
<p class="body">Could turn over an hour</p>
<p class="body">Quick, yeah, so you do this special</p>
<p class="body">The special comes out</p>
<p class="body">And then you</p>
<p class="body">Could do another one in a year</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh I will</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, yeah, that's what I'm talking about, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm working on it right now</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm it's going to be better than this one right here</p>
'cause now I see it gonna get this stomach off and I'm gonna get ready for it</p>
<p class="body">And I just thought I'm thinking about it from that point on</p>
<p class="body">I told Dave when I would I say alright, man, we're gonna follow this up with this this owl and he was like yeah, say</p>
<p class="body">Dead man and he he was the one</p>
<p class="body">Told me don't even try to get a TV show really</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause I was, he wanted to executive produce my TV show</p>
<p class="body">And I was talking to him</p>
<p class="body">He was like listen man, you only wanna go down there bro</p>
<p class="body">And just go be the top comedian for a year</p>
<p class="body">Smell the roses after you drop this, be the top comic thing</p>
<p class="body">Come back like no no no</p>
<p class="body">I wanna be on TV</p>

<p class="body">You beg</p>

<p class="body">I want to make it back</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">With that cut damn make it bag</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know The thing is man with something like that has been in the distance for so long and now you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">That's it, I thought</p>
<p class="body">I was so close to you every day</p>
<p class="body">Get to talk to the President of networking like Boy, I know I'm here and like I'm thinking</p>
<p class="body">Think I'm</p>

<p class="body">But boy, I thought I was close</p>
<p class="body">I swear you couldn't tell me a damn thing Joe, I just knew</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It was going to happen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">What's gonna? </p>
<p class="body">I was I was, uh, you couldn't tell me that it</p>
<p class="body">Was I tell you quake, I think it's for the best I do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I do, I know it would be great to have that, but I think you'd be better on Netflix and I think you're you're</p>
<p class="body">I think you're special is going to be gigantic, and I think from there you doing an even bigger special in a year from now you're going to be</p>
<p class="body">Like thank God I didn't do that, corny as ******* CVS ******** 

<p class="body">I had to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Have to **** ** my jokes and change the subjects and change</p>

<p class="body">Best yeah, I believe that I really do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Not bill</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think there's not</p>
<p class="body">There's not a lot of guys that as funny as you know you</p>
<p class="body">You're at this elite level of stand up comedy where me personally as a comic, but more importantly as a fan of comedy, I Love Excellence</p>
<p class="body">I love when someone achieves this level of harmony with the audience and the material and the delivery and the years and years of performing and the Polish of the</p>
<p class="body">Boom boom boom boom</p>
<p class="body">I mean that special is just one after the other or? </p>
<p class="body">The Bang Bang bang</p>
<p class="body">The pauses are perfect, the timing between the jokes is perfect</p>
<p class="body">It's beautiful man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's what I like ******* sitcom</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, you could say that man you smart, yeah you didn't have them in your Spotify</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Let's take time</p>
<p class="body">I can say yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, being nice I come back</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They can't call me, you call me</p>
<p class="body">I'll start laughing like</p>

<p class="body">What do you wanna know you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I know you'll laugh, I'll be over that ************ I forgive you</p>

<p class="body">Like I forgive you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Let's do it again, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think you</p>
<p class="body">Doing a sitcom anywhere other than Netflix or even HBO, or somewhere where they just let you be free</p>
<p class="body">It's a, it's a a travesty</p>
<p class="body">I think your your material is too you're you're too edgy</p>
<p class="body">You you go out there, you you taught you say risky **** 
<p class="body">And that's beautiful</p>
<p class="body">That's what I love</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">You know what I really wanted to play though</p>
<p class="body">The Black Archie bunker</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh someone no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Black Archie bunker</p>
<p class="body">That's what I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wanted it's amazing that no</p>
<p class="body">One has, I don't</p>
<p class="body">Know I mean 'cause a black I can pull? </p>
<p class="body">It off, Oh yeah, right still yes you could do it 100%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm here, the right one I could</p>
<p class="body">I could pull it off, I could, oh I could pull it off</p>
<p class="body">I'm talking about talking about this show</p>
<p class="body">I mean the black Archie Bunker, oh</p>
<p class="body">Oh man, I could pour the things that I've wrote for this show</p>
<p class="body">For the black</p>
<p class="body">We have that and I'm the black Archie Bunker is what I would love to play that right there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, Redd Foxx kind of did that a little bit with red with Fred Sanford</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, just yeah, I wanted a higher note just on on on on Red Fox that kind</p>
<p class="body">Of wake yeah exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm I'm hoping if you do it's gonna be on Netflix and I'm hoping you just go on to do hour after hour after hour</p>
<p class="body">I think</p>
<p class="body">Because your ability to turn over material is extraordinary, and your ability to write is extraordinary, and I think that that's just you, you are just</p>
<p class="body">You have these chops that very few people develop you</p>
<p class="body">You don't get a chance you don't get a chance to hit that level</p>
<p class="body">Of of excellence as a comic 'cause it does not</p>
<p class="body">How many guys get through it? </p>
<p class="body">Like how many of us are there? </p>
<p class="body">Let's talk about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">True that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is there even 1000 of us on Earth. No, probably not. If you want to be honest like a real headliner, how many of us? Yeah there might be 500 of us on Earth earth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">No yes</p>
<p class="body">Sure, sure, yes on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There's a million</p>
<p class="body">Doctors in America alone</p>
<p class="body">How many comics are there? </p>
<p class="body">Real ones? </p>
<p class="body">Real guys can go up there and light a room on fire</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, maybe maybe a few 100</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so when someone gets there like you I 
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">It is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Want you to? </p>
<p class="body">Stay there</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I want you to get everything everything you want</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I want you to get all the accolades and all the money and all the the</p>
<p class="body">Make it back, but **** does</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Sitcom you sound just like Dave</p>
<p class="body">You know that I</p>
<p class="body">Could tell both of y'all together</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's why I love him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah you and data say that's the same thing he told me before I even did ** **** 
**** that you don't need that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause Dave and I we both have **** you money, that's what</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Say what you want</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah I do</p>
<p class="body">If I don't work, goddamnit I'm in trouble money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But that keeps you hungry and sharp</p>
<p class="body">There's something about that too man the show</p>
<p class="body">There's something beautiful about that too, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">It's beautiful, it is and I I just want to experience</p>
<p class="body">Let's see that in</p>
<p class="body">In my defense, y'all both had successful TV shows</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
100%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Y'all both have already achieved that feather in your cap, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
100%</p>
<p class="body">I developed the ability to say **** you because</p>
<p class="body">Of fear factor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">You will</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, I got that fear factor money and then I was like oh I'm free now I'm free and then I just I just I wouldn't listen</p>
<p class="body">To anybody anymore</p>
<p class="body">And that's when I started doing the podcast</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And and look at you</p>
<p class="body">Yeah listen man, I watch you I that's why I was going to call you like alright man how do I 'cause I my show was on Kevin Hart and it's on Sirius right here and I I watch you I was like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's on Sirius, right, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">How much longer you doing it on that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I do one year deals, that's good</p>
<p class="body">I only do one year deals and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But this is my my thought on that like first of all, being connected to Kevin Hart is a blessing</p>
<p class="body">It's a amazing thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's an amazing guy, but the problem with something like serious is it's limited to people who have serious true, which is a lot</p>
<p class="body">Lot of people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it also doesn't work in a tunnel</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, it's weird</p>
<p class="body">Like the satellite thing is weird</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know it's</p>
<p class="body">The Internet is better like you don't want. I don't wanna TuneIn when it's on I wanna get it whenever the **** I want it I wanna download it before I get on a plane. You know I want if I'm going to listen to a podcast, I want to listen to it when I'm running</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I want to press start when I want you know and that's the beauty of the Internet and satellite was amazing when it came along</p>
<p class="body">Because when it came along, it was uncensored</p>
<p class="body">It's like all of a sudden you have this uncensored medium that's basically like when Howard Stern went over to Sirius, it was a giant thing because</p>
<p class="body">You got this guy who's the greatest uncensored radio personality ever</p>
<p class="body">Everybody says that he's the guy opened up the doors for everybody liked me and now now he could be uncensored</p>
<p class="body">Now he now he can go wild</p>
<p class="body">He doesn't have to worry about the government like people forget the government was coming after Howard Stern</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes they were</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The FCC was finding them hundreds of thousands of dollars</p>
<p class="body">Every time he would say things that are easy now</p>
<p class="body">Now what? </p>
<p class="body">All those things that he said are nothing comparison to things we say every day but back then it was a big ******* deal and he was the guy that got arrested or got in trouble rather than sued</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He was the guy who broke down all the doors just like guys like Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce and George Carlin got arrested for material</p>
<p class="body">He was in trouble</p>
<p class="body">He was in trouble for talking</p>
<p class="body">To put the Internet doesn't have any of those restrictions, like if your show that you're doing on Kevin Hart's thing, you just take it to the podcast world. It'll be ******* huge too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">I never understood</p>
<p class="body">The background and everything had to do with podcasts, but I knew everybody had one going on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's just talking **** and you're a master at that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah yeah, I was like everybody ******* podcast, but uhm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's what it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Earthquake </h4> 
<p class="body">And I did radio</p>
<p class="body">And regular</p>
<p class="body">Ready go and that was went well</p>
<p class="body">I wanted to be like Steve and get syndicated in 90 cities</p>
<p class="body">You know terrestrial and ready to go but then Moe's ain't let me do it evil so I say I ain't come to New York to be number one I want to be heard all throughout the country and it was WBLS so I tried that so I</p>
<p class="body">I always did radio, but I never understood what it was with the podcast and then when I heard about you</p>
<p class="body">I was like *** **** it</p>
<p class="body">Send me to school and then when I saw you when we was on tour, I was like Joe</p>
<p class="body">I need to talk so you</p>
