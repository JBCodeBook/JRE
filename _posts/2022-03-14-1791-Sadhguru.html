<p class="body">Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by Night, all day.</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Pleasure to meet you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">How it goes? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right there, yeah, like pulling a fist from your face is what I usually tell people</p>
<p class="body">Well, I'm enjoying your book</p>
<p class="body">Which one? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">What are you reading? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm in the middle of inner engineering</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Which one? </p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Why is that funny that a funny one? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, that was the</p>
<p class="body">I mean, after the three books have come, so I was thinking you must have gotten a</p>
<p class="body">More recent one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, I found some of your stuff online and I started watching some of your videos online and they're very interesting and very educational</p>
<p class="body">And then I said, alright, let me find out what this guy is all about and so I got it into that book</p>
<p class="body">How did you find out about me? </p>
<p class="body">Because your people reached out to be on here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, right now we are on this soil mission</p>
<p class="body">I brought you a little bit of gift</p>
<p class="body">It's an Indian mint</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Indian mint</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This leaf on empty stomach</p>
<p class="body">If you just chew 2 leaves, they're not very pleasant to eat and then drink some, maybe tepid, water</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is a great blood purifier</p>
<p class="body">Blood cure yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Purifer has it purify your blood</p>
<p class="body">How does that work? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It has the necessary juices in it to do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The necessary juices save soil</p>
<p class="body">I always wondered about these things about pots that plants come in</p>
<p class="body">Do you think plants like that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Huh, definitely not</p>
<p class="body">They would like to grow wild</p>
<p class="body">This is just a baby</p>
<p class="body">It's in a nursery</p>
<p class="body">You have to take it home and put it</p>
<p class="body">In your backyard. OK that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what I wanted to hear</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Not a much bigger part</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because once I started learning about mycology and how</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is this is not where it would like</p>
<p class="body">This is just a baby</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Just a baby, even a big pot</p>
<p class="body">They don't really like that right? </p>
<p class="body">They would like to be in the ground</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">These can these can ground is best</p>
<p class="body">There's no question because there is a ecosystem which has to connect with</p>
<p class="body">It, there's nothing like the ground, but because in Texas or in Austin it could get</p>
<p class="body">Too cold for her</p>
<p class="body">Oh, so she may not survive in your garden, then you have to bring her in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't her to die</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Want so winter time? </p>
<p class="body">Maybe you will have to bring it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In so so maybe I can pot it outside during the spring and then put it inside</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Until you have to bring it in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, alright we'll work it out</p>
<p class="body">We'll figure it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Because she's Indian, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">She's Indian, yeah I know don't wanna</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean really Indian, not a Native American, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They have a lot of Indian animals in Texas</p>
<p class="body">Believe it or not, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Axis deer</p>
<p class="body">It's very common animal out here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Really OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, they're they imported them here</p>
<p class="body">I don't know when, but they're all over the place</p>
<p class="body">I saw one like six months ago on the side of the road</p>
<p class="body">So some things from India survived, but a lot of them died off last year</p>
<p class="body">We had a very big freeze that lasted for a couple of weeks and a lot of lot of exotic animals from other countries</p>
<p class="body">That people brought in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Unless they are from northern part of India where it's in the Himalayan region, they may survive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But South Indian animals like me</p>
<p class="body">Won't make it in winter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you're on this Grand Tour right now</p>
<p class="body">You're saying you just got back from you, were in New York, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, I was in. I just came from I2 days ago</p>
<p class="body">Then I was in New York, Tennessee, New York, and here and today</p>
<p class="body">This night I'm leaving for Caribbean because we are making signing some</p>
<p class="body">Memorandum of understanding with the CARICOM nations for the soil safe soil movement so they're all coming on board. We have made a policy document specific for each country depending on their latitude, soil types, economic conditions, and agricultural traditions of an individual nation. Based on this 192 nations</p>
<p class="body">We've made soil policies</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this is something that you're very concerned about, and rightly so that there's a problem with the topsoil in America in particular that we've been aware of for a long time, but there's only like what is, what's the number, like 45 years worth of topsoil left? If we go about practices the same way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So sliding means on one level there is loss of nutrients in the food and another level</p>
<p class="body">And the highest suicide rate give debt only what is suitable for that crop</p>
<p class="body">All right? </p>
<p class="body">It's not like they're going to give you a billion dollars to do some farming</p>
<p class="body">They're going to calculate and give you why is he not able to pay it back? </p>
<p class="body">He's not able to pay it back</p>
<p class="body">One main reason he's the input cost is going up year on year because the soil fertility is going down and the input</p>
<p class="body">Cost is going up to a point where it's no more practical to do it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There was also some sort of an an issue with Monsanto, correct? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Those things are there, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You don't think that's a big deal? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It would be if it came big time, but Monsanto is not so big time in India yet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh no, the policies have kind of blocked it and made it regulated, so we're not</p>
<p class="body">We have not taken to GMO crops in a big way, only a few few items we have taken</p>
<p class="body">Even that people are protesting and generally farmers are aware and most people large number of farmers have rejected it so</p>
<p class="body">That's a different aspect</p>
<p class="body">See the problem is always</p>
<p class="body">We are always seeing whom to hit</p>
<p class="body">Alright, so this is a moment which is not against anybody because</p>
<p class="body">In this one thing we can all come together as one we may be of different nations</p>
<p class="body">We may be of different racial backgrounds, religious backgrounds, caste, creed, gender, whatever, and political ideologies, whatever</p>
<p class="body">But we all come from soil live off the soil and when we die we go back to the soil</p>
<p class="body">The only question we have in our life is</p>
<p class="body">Will we get this? </p>
<p class="body">That soil is the basis of our existence here</p>
<p class="body">Will we get this now or will we get it when we buried? </p>
<p class="body">That's the only choice we have</p>
<p class="body">So having said that, see people are talking about organic farming</p>
<p class="body">These are all</p>
<p class="body">Urban people talking about it</p>
<p class="body">They've never farmed in their life</p>
<p class="body">They don't know what it means to do organic farming right now</p>
<p class="body">If the world shifts to organic farming</p>
<p class="body">That is death for most of the population</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So when they're talking about organic farming, they're talking about farming with no pesticides, no herbicides</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No pesticides, no fertilizer</p>
<p class="body">All this for this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No fertilizer fertilizer is non organic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, it is chemical fertilizer right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, but what about organic fertilizer? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That is a man</p>
<p class="body">You're right that is organic content is different so that so people who are talking about this it's an ideal life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's something</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But will Farmer, who is doing it for his commercial requirement? </p>
<p class="body">Will he be able to conduct his agriculture in an idealistic way? </p>
<p class="body">No, believe me, I've</p>
<p class="body">In engage with farmers, it's not like that</p>
<p class="body">It's like you're eating good food, but if you have yourself checked up, your doctor may say, well, your calcium is little deficient you iron is deficient, right? </p>
<p class="body">So take these two pills</p>
<p class="body">So you took these two pills and tomorrow you felt great</p>
<p class="body">Then you decided you don't have to really eat food</p>
<p class="body">You can just eat a lot of these pills and you will be fine</p>
<p class="body">That is how we have done agriculture</p>
<p class="body">We had rich soil in that whatever is with deficient, we we put a little bit of nitrogen or phosphate or something</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly the crops burst out. Yeah, then we forgot that we have to put organic content. We just started putting these salts forever and in 25 to 30 years time the soil becomes fallow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's a book I read years ago called Dead Doctors Don't lie by a man named Doctor Joel Wallach and it talked about mineral deficiencies from topsoils</p>
<p class="body">It was a big issue and one of the things that he brought up is that</p>
<p class="body">People who grow agriculture and have animals have known forever that they have to supplement the animals diets with minerals and that this is primarily because the food that they're getting is not minerally, sufficient, and that's the same thing with our own food</p>
<p class="body">Is it? </p>
<p class="body">Even though you can grow a lot of these vegetables</p>
<p class="body">You're not getting the same nutrients that you would if you had rich topsoil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Not at all</p>
<p class="body">Not at all</p>
<p class="body">So the amount of nourishment or micronutrients that you got from a given vegetable, let's say in early 20th century, let's say 1920 and today what you're getting from the same thing, is approximately 10% of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
10%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That yes, 90% drop has happened, so it's especially</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wow, enough to grow the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This food, these studies are available in United States everywhere in the world. They're not enough studies, but it could be a similar number, if not the same amount. It could be something like that anywhere between 10 to 25%, let's say</p>
<p class="body">For example, if you ate an orange in 1920 today to get the same stuff, you will have to eat 8 oranges</p>
<p class="body">Wow, so it's simply not practical. So people think these malnourishment, these problems, and these starvation, these things will happen only to Africa or South America, or somewhere. No World Food program predicts that by 2035. There could be famines around Illinois region</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because the food that they're eating is deficient</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, The thing is the soil has been so used up. You heard of 1930s the Dust Bowl yesterday I was in New York and I was talking to somebody there</p>
<p class="body">So they're saying that some whatever volume</p>
<p class="body">I don't know the volume, but some enormous amount of dust came and settled in New York City</p>
<p class="body">When the dust bowls just came up like you know it just blinded the whole half the country</p>
<p class="body">So people are calculating how many, whatever million tons or hundreds and thousands of tons of dust or soil landed up in New York City</p>
<p class="body">See it stopped in New York City because of the tall buildings and stuff</p>
<p class="body">But how many millions of tons of soil American soil went and landed in Atlantic Ocean that you can never calculate, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">When we farmers are growing these monocrop</p>
<p class="body">Agriculture, like if they're they're growing corn or soy or things like that</p>
<p class="body">It is that part of the problems</p>
<p class="body">It's not enough regenerative agriculture, not enough manure</p>
<p class="body">Animals grazing in the same lands</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Monoculture is a basic problem, OK? </p>
<p class="body">And we've gotten into this kind of thing because we are looking at soil like some industrial machine that we put in so much and we have to get so much</p>
<p class="body">But soil is a living thing. If you take a handful of soil, there are anywhere between 7 to 10,010 billion organisms in it anywhere between 50 to 75,000 species of organisms in it</p>
<p class="body">But now with we are plowing with machines</p>
<p class="body">It plows anywhere between 12 to 14 inches</p>
87% of the life on this planet, including you and me, come from the 1st 12 to 15 inches</p>
<p class="body">Of the soil</p>
<p class="body">But we are plowing the soil 12 to 14 inches, leaving it open to harsh sunlight and leaving it like that for months</p>
<p class="body">That itself is a tremendous damage we have taken to this because</p>
<p class="body">Both monoculture you crop everything at once</p>
<p class="body">If it was multiculture, you would crop one thing the other thing</p>
<p class="body">Other thing would be still there</p>
<p class="body">And when you by the time you crop that, another one would have again grown up</p>
<p class="body">You know there would be some greenery on the soil and organic activity would be going on</p>
<p class="body">Microorganisms would be alive and active</p>
<p class="body">But now it's a single crop</p>
<p class="body">You take everything out by machines, plow it, and leave it open to the sun</p>
<p class="body">That's causing a massive damage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Now if we do it another way, if you have a bunch of different plants growing there and you you leave trees for shade and all sorts, is there enough land? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">So it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">With what you're what they're growing on now with the amount of food that they're growing now, is this scalable? </p>
<p class="body">If you have some sort of regenerative agriculture plan? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We can grow much more on much less land really. Yes. See, we have been doing this for over 2425 years now</p>
<p class="body">We've converted a few 100,000 farmers into what is called as tree based agriculture. Earlier we used to call it as</p>
<p class="body">The agroforestry then it came under trouble, because then the whole thing went under the Forest Ministry</p>
<p class="body">Forest Ministry is full of restrictions</p>
<p class="body">It is actually agricultural land, but it was called as agroforestry, so we retitled it as tree based agriculture</p>
<p class="body">So now it's under the Agriculture ministry</p>
<p class="body">Because it's farmers land, it's not forestland, right? </p>
<p class="body">So by doing this properly, there are scientific ways of doing it</p>
<p class="body">Different crops can be done differently and pruning the trees at the right time and taking that C enough</p>
<p class="body">Green material should be generated on the farm</p>
<p class="body">Enough animal waste must be generated on the farm</p>
<p class="body">Right now animals have gone out of the farms</p>
<p class="body">And trees have gone off the farm</p>
<p class="body">So where is the organic material? </p>
<p class="body">These are only two two sources of organic material that you have in the world</p>
<p class="body">You may have any kind because I have been in California in the last month and whatever you say somebody comes up and says Sadhguru, my friend has made an app</p>
<p class="body">It can solve any problem</p>
<p class="body">See with technology you may</p>
<p class="body">Be able to improve the application</p>
<p class="body">I'll give that margin, but you cannot generate organic content with technology</p>
<p class="body">It's only plant life and animal life which can create</p>
<p class="body">Organic content there is no way you can generate organic content anywhere else</p>
<p class="body">It has to come from the land simply</p>
<p class="body">There is no other way if I can tell you a joke, you getting very serious about this soil business</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I love a joke</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This happened in 2060. A few scientists from the planet</p>
<p class="body">Got an appointment with God? </p>
<p class="body">They wanted to meet him</p>
<p class="body">They went there and said, hey old man, you don't pretty well with creation</p>
<p class="body">But today everything that you can do, we can also do it's time you retire</p>
<p class="body">God said always that</p>
<p class="body">So what is it that you can do? </p>
<p class="body">So they dug up a little bit of soil and made a vague picture of a human child and did so many things and within a few minutes the child set up alive</p>
<p class="body">God said, oh that's really impressive</p>
<p class="body">But first get your own soil</p>
<p class="body">Everything whether it's a worm or an insect or a plant or a bird or an animal or human beings, we've all come from soil</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing else here on this planet, which is not the the source is not soil</p>
<p class="body">Everything the sources soil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So say if you have something that's a large mono crop, like corn</p>
<p class="body">It's a big one in America, and you wanted to</p>
<p class="body">Transfer transform the way they're growing corn and make it so that it's sustainable and that you have some sort of regenerative regenerative agriculture situation</p>
<p class="body">How would you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Do that, see if you wanted to grow monocrops I</p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't advise that I that's not the best way to do it, but for commercial reasons you want to do monocropping</p>
<p class="body">Right, right, you're a corn farmer</p>
<p class="body">You don't want to grow anything else</p>
<p class="body">If that is so, you must put back substantial amount of organic content, because even if you take a corn plant which grows almost 6 to 7 feet tall and you're only eating the corn, you don't have animals on the farm</p>
<p class="body">Largely if you just the plant part of it</p>
<p class="body">If you just chop it into pieces and put it back in the soil</p>
<p class="body">The soil will be very happy you got your corn anyway and</p>
<p class="body">So I will be very</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Rich, what do they do with? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It now right now they Bale it up and sell it to somebody</p>
<p class="body">Some people in some countries they just burn it</p>
<p class="body">They use it as fuel for you know household purposes or they use it in so many other ways</p>
<p class="body">But it is not going back into</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The soil and they just use commercial fertilizer</p>
<p class="body">For growing plants</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, that will last C that will last for 1st 1020 years maximum</p>
<p class="body">After that it will start diminishing because you can't just grow with salts, you need organic content because the way the soil mechanics happen is it's a very complex and sophisticated marketplace</p>
<p class="body">The plants have to capture the carbon from the atmosphere and make it into carbon sugars and that is the currency with which it can exchange for nutrients with organisms</p>
<p class="body">They won't give it free</p>
<p class="body">So even in our own stomach you today, you know that without the gut microbiome, you cannot really digest the food that you eat without their cooperation, though</p>
<p class="body">What is happening in the soil is probably 1010 thousand or a million times more complex operation. Who we are right now as a life we are</p>
<p class="body">Just a consequence of what's happening in the soil, even in the evolutionary process</p>
<p class="body">That's how it's happened</p>
<p class="body">That today what we are right now over 60% of our body is actually micro organisms only 40% is our parental genetics</p>
<p class="body">Rest is all micro organisms</p>
<p class="body">So what we are now is a reflection of what's in the soil</p>
<p class="body">The moment you weaken the soil, life on the planet will start becoming weak</p>
<p class="body">People don't notice this</p>
<p class="body">I know this is a controversial thing to say</p>
<p class="body">But I think you're known for controversy</p>
<p class="body">So what's my problem? </p>
<p class="body">So I'm saying, see for example, there are certain countries which are suffering this whole corona virus much more than the other</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to make a absolute statement about this, but one thing is something we must look at is any doctor</p>
<p class="body">You don't need</p>
<p class="body">A top viral a</p>
<p class="body">Just a simple doctor will tell you if you lack vitamin A, vitamin B6B12 DE and you know fully 8 and iron and zinc and magnesium in your</p>
<p class="body">The system you will become susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections</p>
<p class="body">This is a known fact</p>
<p class="body">Yes O</p>
<p class="body">What is the deficiency in America? </p>
<p class="body">Vitamin E most Americans are 90% deficient D</p>
<p class="body">Yes, vitamin A 43% deficient vitamin C 39% deficient like this. You can go on with all these deficiencies. We are trying to make it up with pills I see. I was in Los Angeles last month</p>
<p class="body">And there is a building sized hoarding which says my favorite pharmacy</p>
<p class="body">Said when did this happen? </p>
<p class="body">When the next thing is you'll say my favorite hospital</p>
<p class="body">Next thing you'll say my favorite cemetery</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, your pharmacy and hospital and cemetery are not favorite places we go there only when it's inevitable</p>
<p class="body">We may have</p>
<p class="body">To go there</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but we don't wish to go there when you say something is my favorite, you want to go there all right? </p>
<p class="body">That's what it means</p>
<p class="body">So you should never have a favorite pharmacy or a favorite cemetery for that matter</p>
<p class="body">It is a place when it's inevitable something some trouble came</p>
<p class="body">We will have to go</p>
<p class="body">But today it's become the norm in, well, the most affluent country in the nation where there's a variety of choices of nourishment in this country</p>
<p class="body">Without pills you cannot exist</p>
<p class="body">Because the food doesn't have the stuff</p>
<p class="body">So once the food doesn't have the stuff people won't have it either</p>
<p class="body">All animals won't have it either, so the very species will become weaker and weaker by the day in a few generations it'll become so weak that we won't be able to sustain a common cold</p>
<p class="body">We could become like that, so you taking a pill will bridge you for some time</p>
<p class="body">It is not a solution for life</p>
<p class="body">When something is lacking, a pill will bridges across a little bit, but it is not a solution how it comes through the complex mechanism of food and how it becomes part of our body and a simple chemical of a tablet</p>
<p class="body">They are not the same thing</p>
<p class="body">They will not do the same things to us and what other consequences it has nobody can</p>
<p class="body">Never estimate because there are so many other consequences in a country like United States where there is a whole choice of nourishment and a whole choice of lifestyles</p>
<p class="body">You are spending nearly three and a half trillion dollars in health care. That is a huge statement about America's health</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, it's it's very obvious if you look at most Americans and what's really interesting is there was a. There's been some photos that people have put up recently of beaches from the 1970s and you see these people on the beach with their shirts off and bikinis on and</p>
<p class="body">They look so good they look so much healthier</p>
<p class="body">They look so much different than people look today when you go to the beach today you have a large</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's a representative of America and in America it's some large percentage of people are overweight</p>
<p class="body">A lot of that is 'cause what's fast and quick and available and ignorance</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See one one thing about one thing about obesity is</p>
<p class="body">So when the food lacks the necessary nutrients, the body longs for more food</p>
<p class="body">Yes to fulfill</p>
<p class="body">Knee so you end up eating more and more thinking you will</p>
<p class="body">I mean the body is thinking that it'll get nourishment by eating more, right? </p>
<p class="body">That more makes you grow horizontally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, and it's also like the kind of food you know</p>
<p class="body">If there's food that has a lot of sugar in it, your body freaks out and it just wants more of it</p>
<p class="body">It can't stop eating it because it's an unnatural state</p>
<p class="body">To have that much sugar in something that doesn't have fiber, that, like if you're drinking a sugary drink</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<p class="body">It's I don't know how to say this</p>
<p class="body">I'm not being disparaging about a nation or a society, but the food choices in America are atrocious</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Go ahead</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of bad choices, but it's also there's a disconnect in America because there's so many people that live in urban environments</p>
<p class="body">That are completely removed from the process of growing, raising cattle, raising animals, raising food, growing vegetables</p>
<p class="body">They have no connection to it</p>
<p class="body">They don't know about it at all</p>
<p class="body">They just look for the term organic when they go to the supermarket and they feel like they're healthy</p>
<p class="body">If they do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, I mean, this is not a talking about women's choices of footwear, but I call this high heel life. That means you're well above the earth</p>
<p class="body">You're living in an apartment which is 14 floors above the Earth</p>
<p class="body">You're working all the time with insulated from the earth in every way</p>
<p class="body">You are trying to be away from the earth</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, which is the wrong way</p>
<p class="body">You people may believe they will go to different types of heavens depending on their belief systems</p>
<p class="body">But we all come from the same soil being connected with that is most essential because the body is thriving only because of its natural connection</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, they have classes now where people are grounding</p>
<p class="body">Where they go outside and they take their shoes off and walk around, then lay on the ground</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They're paying money to hug a cow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Like they have to teach them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">How to do it, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Legitimate tree hugging like real tree hugging like it used to be a, you know, a term that we use to people to make fun of them</p>
<p class="body">But now it's legitimate like people are hugging trees to try to get better</p>
<p class="body">Grounding is like the the principles of grounding</p>
<p class="body">The idea is that there's some sort of a connection that you get</p>
<p class="body">From mother Earth that the only way you get it is to be bare skin touching the grass and the soil, and that there's actually a benefit to that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Now they're mainly talking about the electrical positive charge getting neutralized that</p>
<p class="body">Is that is true it is</p>
<p class="body">It is true, but it's not the most important aspect</p>
<p class="body">The more important aspect is</p>
<p class="body">The microbial life in your body and the microbial life in the soil are cousins</p>
<p class="body">They need to meet</p>
<p class="body">They need reunions often</p>
<p class="body">If that doesn't happen, you're living like a lab rat all the time</p>
<p class="body">Washing yourself up with all kinds of things that nothing can be on your hands</p>
<p class="body">Nothing can be on your feet, so there is no connection</p>
<p class="body">With the source in that the body suffers and today there is substantial scientific data to show how</p>
<p class="body">You know, micronutrients or lack of micronutrients and mental illnesses are very directly connected</p>
<p class="body">Yes, today The Who is predicting a mental illness pandemic. See what this means is we said coronavirus pandemic. What this means is</p>
<p class="body">If we are in this room 3 people</p>
<p class="body">All three of us are susceptible</p>
<p class="body">We may get it all right now</p>
<p class="body">Mental illness pandemic means just that</p>
<p class="body">Any one of us can go lose it right now</p>
<p class="body">Well, we're going there</p>
<p class="body">I mean in in 2020 in Japan, more people committed suicide than they died of coronavirus. How's that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's pretty crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So in a country where it's affluent, they're not dying for economic reasons, obviously not because of poverty, not because of hunger</p>
<p class="body">No, just they're not able to handle their own minds</p>
<p class="body">One important aspect, it's not the only aspect, but one important aspect is lack of micronutrients that's directly connected to the type of soil that we're walking up on right now, and where we grow food</p>
<p class="body">When we say where we grow food, 71% of the world's soil or world's land is under cultivation in the world</p>
<p class="body">So why I'm focusing on agricultural soil? </p>
<p class="body">People ask why not what rainforest, why not the ocean? Yes, all those things need to be taken care of. I 100% agree with that but</p>
<p class="body">Agricultural soil is that place agricultural land is that place which is every day tended to by a human being</p>
<p class="body">A man or a woman is on the land tending to it</p>
<p class="body">The place that is being regularly tended to by a human being is in its worst possible condition where there is no human footprint</p>
<p class="body">Everything seems to be fine</p>
<p class="body">Well the problem is just this</p>
<p class="body">See, we are the most intelligent species on the planet, or more intellectual species on the planet</p>
<p class="body">I would I would like to withdraw the intelligence aspect</p>
<p class="body">We are the most competent for sure</p>
<p class="body">In terms of ability to do things</p>
<p class="body">Our competence is increasing by the day. What 1000 people or 10,000 people could not do. 1000 years ago today, one man can do that is the level of competence. Because of technology we have that</p>
<p class="body">With this level of competence and intellect</p>
<p class="body">One important thing is we must be functioning consciously</p>
<p class="body">If we function unconsciously and compulsively, we become a destructive force</p>
<p class="body">All this destruction is happened not because of some evil plan</p>
<p class="body">When you mentioned a company and said is it them? </p>
<p class="body">This is why I don't want this narrative to grow</p>
<p class="body">It is not happened because of some evil plan</p>
<p class="body">This has happened in search of human well being</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In search of human well being</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, human beings trying to be happy human beings trying to live well</p>
<p class="body">That is why they turned a planet upside down, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In some ways, but it's also profit</p>
<p class="body">Human beings trying to profit, so they're doing things that aren't necessarily sustainable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">People want people want profit because that is the only way</p>
<p class="body">They can be well</p>
<p class="body">Those who are making losses, are they well? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, sort of, but a lot of them, they're they're already well, they're they're greedy, they they've gotten past the point of being well, and now they've gotten connected to the idea of accumulating vast sums of money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See that is that is</p>
<p class="body">That is being judgmental</p>
<p class="body">Calling somebody greedy because</p>
<p class="body">See if I have one meal a day, which is my normal</p>
<p class="body">I think I'm doing fine</p>
<p class="body">If somebody else has one meal a day, he thinks he's very poor</p>
<p class="body">He wants 2</p>
<p class="body">The guy is having two</p>
<p class="body">Thinks he's poor because somebody else is having three</p>
<p class="body">One who has a little home</p>
<p class="body">He thinks he's poor because somebody has a big home like this</p>
<p class="body">So what is greed and what is not greed? </p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't like to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, I'll tell you what greed is</p>
<p class="body">If you make choices where you know that the thing that you are doing, whether you're distributing a product or whether you're causing an action that is going to be detrimental to human beings, but you cover up the data to hide the fact that it's going to be detrimental because you want to maximize your profit and you don't care</p>
<p class="body">About the negative impact it has on people, 'cause you're only thinking about money and you're already substantially wealthy, that by definition, is being greedy, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See by definition it's like this</p>
<p class="body">Somebody is dreaming of $1,000,000. He thinks that is the ultimate goal in his life, but a guy who has a million is wanting to be a</p>
<p class="body">Billionaire right? </p>
<p class="body">One who is a billionaire. He looks at somebody who has $100 billion. He thinks at least that much</p>
<p class="body">He must have</p>
<p class="body">Right, so I'm saying instead of being judgmental about this human well being is sought from outside</p>
<p class="body">That is the whole problem</p>
<p class="body">Human experience essentially happens from within</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's your</p>
<p class="body">Joy or misery comes from within you, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Maybe somebody or something can stimulate it from outside, but still it happens within you</p>
<p class="body">Joy and misery happens from within you</p>
<p class="body">Pain and pleasure happens from within you</p>
<p class="body">Agony and ecstasy happens from within you</p>
<p class="body">Every human experience happens from within you</p>
<p class="body">But in pursuit of happiness, we're turning the world upside down</p>
<p class="body">Because this is the case of a</p>
<p class="body">You know there was a old potato farmer one day he wanted to eat apples, so he went to an apple tree</p>
<p class="body">But by habit he started digging for the apples</p>
<p class="body">Till the tree came down on</p>
<p class="body">Him because he's a</p>
<p class="body">Potato farmer, so right human beings have become like this</p>
<p class="body">They have gotten used to this that they think by getting this by getting that by having one more thing and one more thing they're going to</p>
<p class="body">Be happy</p>
<p class="body">Yes, but human experience happens from within</p>
<p class="body">If you take charge of your interiority</p>
<p class="body">Being peaceful and happy is a natural consequence of that</p>
<p class="body">But for convenience and comfort, we do things outside to create impact</p>
<p class="body">We do things outside, so this experience of if human beings were naturally joyful by their own nature</p>
<p class="body">They would only do what is needed, nothing more, nothing less, but right now</p>
<p class="body">They're in pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">You can't stop them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's a diffusion of responsibility because you don't think about your own involvement and what the corporation is doing</p>
<p class="body">You think about your role, what you do as a job</p>
<p class="body">And then you try to maximize profit, and it's a game that people get wrapped up</p>
<p class="body">In yeah, but that is</p>
<p class="body">Doesn't make them happy</p>
<p class="body">You're absolutely correct</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no</p>
<p class="body">It's in pursuit of happiness</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But what's in pursuit of success? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, most human beings cannot be happy if they're not successful, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's a lot of that, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, there it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And then they get medicated to help them get happy</p>
<p class="body">That's a lot of people</p>
<p class="body">I mean, what percentage of people are not following by the principles that you're espousing, which would are very natural and very healthy</p>
<p class="body">And they instead follow this corporate structure</p>
<p class="body">The corporate guidelines, they they follow that path, and they're not happy</p>
<p class="body">So what do they do? </p>
<p class="body">They medicate themselves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, today we've come to this place where</p>
<p class="body">If you want to be peaceful, you need a chemical</p>
<p class="body">You want to be joyful</p>
<p class="body">You need a chemical</p>
<p class="body">You want to be helpful</p>
<p class="body">You need a chemical</p>
<p class="body">Well, you want to be ecstatic, of course</p>
<p class="body">There is a chemical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So what is the consequence of this? </p>
<p class="body">Why this is happening? </p>
<p class="body">One thing is, in this generation, one thing that's happened in peoples minds is the heaven has collapsed in peoples minds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The heaven yes, how so? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, I've been talking to people 50 years ago</p>
<p class="body">If I spoke to people</p>
<p class="body">And I asked how many of you want to go to heaven. Almost 80% would raise their hands</p>
<p class="body">Today you go to your university and ask them how many of you want to go to</p>
<p class="body">Heaven they'll say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">She she she</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They think it's a pretty close question</p>
<p class="body">All right</p>
<p class="body">Nobody will raise their hand, so in their minds heaven is collapsed</p>
<p class="body">There's no place to go</p>
<p class="body">So they wanna do it everything here all right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I said 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So they have not found how to be joyful and ecstatic within themselves</p>
<p class="body">So chemical usage, initially it became alcohol</p>
<p class="body">Then it became chemicals</p>
<p class="body">It's getting stronger and stronger and you know so many people dying of those things every every day and illnesses and it's costing a nation in the world a lot</p>
<p class="body">It's not just in one country, it's it's going across the world</p>
<p class="body">Law enforcement agencies may be controlling it a little bit</p>
<p class="body">But they can never control it totally because the consumption is mass based, it is</p>
<p class="body">More people may be consuming these things than people eating bread</p>
<p class="body">It's becoming like that</p>
<p class="body">So this whole movement where it's going means if you do not raise human consciousness if you do not teach people how to sit here feeling absolutely blissed out within yourself by your own nature because</p>
<p class="body">This human mechanism is the most sophisticated chemical factory</p>
<p class="body">If you are a good CEO</p>
<p class="body">You would produce the chemicals that will give you fantastic experience if you're a lousy CEO, you're giving yourself a bad experience</p>
<p class="body">Yes, now you're buying chemicals from outside to fix that</p>
<p class="body">Alright, so essentially you're a bad manager of your own system</p>
<p class="body">You're not taking charge of this</p>
<p class="body">Why is that happen? </p>
<p class="body">Because your education, your society</p>
<p class="body">He's talking about conquering the world, but never taught you anything about how to take charge of this</p>
<p class="body">Do you agree with me the most in this room? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">There's so much technology here in this room, the most complex and sophisticated technology is within your system, yes or no human system</p>
<p class="body">Yes, this is</p>
<p class="body">Have you read the users manual? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's no users manual</p>
<p class="body">There is there is yes where is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It it's built into the machine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh how do? </p>
<p class="body">I get it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You need to pay attention your reading in engineering</p>
<p class="body">Read that carefully, there are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm reading it</p>
<p class="body">I'm in the middle, I'm at part</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">There are pointers as to how to read your own users manual, yes? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let me take you back to this concept of heaven</p>
<p class="body">You know when you're talking about people in universities that you say how many of them want to go to heaven? </p>
<p class="body">The problem is they don't have any evidence of heaven, and so when a lot of these young people that are atheist or agnostics, they don't want to buy into anything that they believe is connected to fairy tales or they're connected to</p>
<p class="body">Some sort of an ideology that they believe was manufactured to control people and to keep people in check</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what I said</p>
<p class="body">The heavens collapsed in their minds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, in their minds</p>
<p class="body">But it's also because heaven is connected to religion and religion is connected to atrocities</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of people that think of religion</p>
<p class="body">They think of the the evils of the Catholic Church or they think of</p>
<p class="body">You know what religion has justified the horrors of history, the things that people have done in the name of religion? </p>
<p class="body">So a lot of younger, sophisticated, intelligent people don't want to believe in anything that there's no evidence for</p>
<p class="body">So when you say how many of them want to go to heaven, say, show me a video, tell me where I'm going, we</p>
<p class="body">Have a map of heaven</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I'm not asking that question offering a ticket, I'm just telling you heaven is collapsed in peoples mind, which is a good thing because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I know</p>
<p class="body">It's a good thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is because</p>
<p class="body">Because the idea</p>
<p class="body">That this is not the place to live</p>
<p class="body">Well, there is another place where you will live well is the wrong idea</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, I see</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is the place to</p>
<p class="body">Live well you can have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Heaven right here, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">And who told you you're not already in heaven and making a mess out of it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No one, I think that's possible</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We are in heaven making a mess out of it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We also could be in hell too, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So right now whether we want to fix the soil or we want to fix the human mind, we are only trying to see that you don't mess up the heaven in which we have landed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Stop war</p>
<p class="body">Yes, I I could agree with that</p>
<p class="body">I think the problem is the term heaven when you say it</p>
<p class="body">People think of a biblical heaven</p>
<p class="body">They think of a place that you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Go in the clouds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Every religion has their own kind of heaven</p>
<p class="body">That's the whole thing I'm saying before Bible came</p>
<p class="body">There have been heavens in other places</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes you know one thing I</p>
<p class="body">Found really interesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is one thing good about</p>
<p class="body">This soil is see</p>
<p class="body">People may even have separate heavens to go to, but we all come from the same soil</p>
<p class="body">Our bodies go back to the same soil, so this is a unifying factor irrespective of 1's religion, caste, creed, whatever else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So in your mind, this concept of heaven relates to like a harmony amongst yourself</p>
<p class="body">The in the people and the living things around</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">This toy 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The in the people and the living things around you, including the soil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Essentially it's like this</p>
<p class="body">If you feel pleasant in your body</p>
<p class="body">We call this health</p>
<p class="body">Yes, if you feel very pleasant in your body we call this pleasure</p>
<p class="body">If you feel pleasant in your mind, we call this peace</p>
<p class="body">If you feel very pleasant, we call this joy</p>
<p class="body">If you feel</p>
<p class="body">Very pleasant if you feel pleasant in your emotion</p>
<p class="body">We call this laugh</p>
<p class="body">If you feel very pleasant, we call it compassion</p>
<p class="body">If you feel very pleasant in your very life energies, then we call this blissfulness</p>
<p class="body">If you become very, very pleasant, then we call it ecstasy</p>
<p class="body">If your surroundings become pleasant, we call it success</p>
<p class="body">So to create pleasantness in the surroundings we need the cooperation of people and forces around us. Without everybody's cooperation you can't create a pleasant atmosphere</p>
<p class="body">But pleasantness of the body pleasantness of the mind, pleasantness of emotion and energy is 100% your business</p>
<p class="body">Isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">So if you're feeling ecstatic</p>
<p class="body">You are in heaven</p>
<p class="body">Because your idea</p>
<p class="body">Of heaven is a very pleasant place, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">This place, this planet Earth is very pleasant except for the human beings who creating unpleasantness among each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, this sounds like a great concept, but human beings are very complex</p>
<p class="body">Their emotions or complex, their needs and desires and their trauma and pain and insecurities and and all mental health issues</p>
<p class="body">How does one get to that spot? </p>
<p class="body">Like what you're saying sounds wonderful</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you're a guru</p>
<p class="body">You're a literal guru, so when you sit here and tell people these things, they go well</p>
<p class="body">That sounds easy for that guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, it's it's not easy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Look at</p>
<p class="body">Him, he's wise and enlightened</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not easy or difficult</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He got a great beard</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not easy or difficult</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">It is a question of wrong direction or right direction</p>
<p class="body">That is, you went to an apple tree and you're digging the roots because you're a potato farmer</p>
<p class="body">That is the only problem you have</p>
<p class="body">You're you are the source and seat of your experiences within you</p>
<p class="body">What happens within you? </p>
<p class="body">Should it happen your way or my way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Tell me your way or my</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Way you know what happens within you</p>
<p class="body">Should it happen your way or my way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, it's within me when you say within me, do you mean my thoughts, do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Your thought, your emotion, your body, whatever your chemistry, your energy, everything, what happens within you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Mean my almost</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Should it happen your way or somebody elses way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, I think if your way sucks, maybe you should listen to other people and maybe try their way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See if it happened your way</p>
<p class="body">Would you keep yourself blissful or miserable? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You would keep yourself blissful if you're a wise</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If you are wise and your mind was working properly, but if you have mental health issues</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no no no no no no no</p>
<p class="body">That that's exactly what I'm saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If you're if</p>
<p class="body">You're filled with trauma</p>
<p class="body">If you're poorly educated, you're starting from a deficit, a severe deficit where you don't think correctly</p>
<p class="body">No they don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, that's not</p>
<p class="body">That is not that is not the problem</p>
<p class="body">The original problem, the root of the problem is this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's address one step at a time</p>
<p class="body">See right now the simple question is what happens in your mind, your emotion, your chemistry? </p>
<p class="body">Your energies must be your way, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It well is yours, yes is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is yours, so it must be your way, but it's not happening your way right now because it's in a compulsive reactive state</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So see anybody can cause anything within you</p>
<p class="body">So if I decide what clothes you must wear, what food you must eat, what you should do every day, you will call this slavery, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Or but the government</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Don't go there</p>
<p class="body">So right now someone else, something else can decide what happens within you</p>
<p class="body">Isn't this the most horrible form of slavery that someone? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's not good, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Not, that's not the best path</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So the problem is just this unintelligence which needs to be conscious is unfortunately unconscious and compulsive, so the only problem that you have is compulsive reaction to life around you</p>
<p class="body">What is needed is a conscious response to life, so this simple thing people have not handled from their childhood</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So when you don't handle this one thing, everything will be wrong</p>
<p class="body">Everything will be accidental</p>
<p class="body">We are success and failure</p>
<p class="body">Both are accidental</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So what do you say to someone? </p>
<p class="body">Maybe they're 30 years old and they've had this life of mistakes and regret and maybe alcoholism or gambling or some other problems, but they want to be conscious</p>
<p class="body">They want to be blissful</p>
<p class="body">They want to be enlightened</p>
<p class="body">They want to be a happy person, filled with love</p>
<p class="body">What path do they take? </p>
<p class="body">What what steps do they take to correct those the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Say why</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Journey they're on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Why is it, though human beings are not the strongest creatures on the planet compared to other species? </p>
<p class="body">Why is it that human beings are dominating this world? </p>
<p class="body">Simply because of our ability to use tools, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And our intellect, our ability to manipulate our environment, yes, but through innovation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no</p>
<p class="body">Yes, but even then if we didn't have knowledge of using tools right, the Buffaloes would have made us down alright, yes, so your intellect, they don't care</p>
<p class="body">It's your ability to use tools</p>
<p class="body">You made an arrow</p>
<p class="body">You made a gun</p>
<p class="body">You made so many things, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Made a house</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Everything, all instruments right now microphone or telephone or whatever else</p>
<p class="body">These are all instruments to enhance</p>
<p class="body">We are this much because of our instruments we become that much right now</p>
<p class="body">There is one little screw here in this furniture</p>
<p class="body">I will ask you, you're a strong guy</p>
<p class="body">I will ask you to unscrew this with your hands</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Can't do it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You do it</p>
<p class="body">You may lose all your nails</p>
<p class="body">I will allow you to use your teeth maybe</p>
<p class="body">You lose some of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's gonna be a problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But it'll be right there, but if I give you a screwdriver boom in a minute, you will get it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If I had a screwdriver</p>
<p class="body">I could do it easy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So this is the power of the tool</p>
<p class="body">So as there are tools for doing things in the external world, there are tools to handle this because you don't have a toolkit</p>
<p class="body">This machine, which is the most complex machine</p>
<p class="body">Is going crazy right now you're reading in engineering</p>
<p class="body">It's a toolkit, yes, you just use the tools</p>
<p class="body">Don't worry about the philosophy</p>
<p class="body">Don't worry about belief system</p>
<p class="body">Don't worry about your concept</p>
<p class="body">Somebody is concepts, your beliefs</p>
<p class="body">Somebody is beliefs</p>
<p class="body">Just use the necessary tools</p>
<p class="body">Being peaceful, joyful, loving is a natural outcome of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, well what are those tools like? </p>
<p class="body">Like the scenario that I laid out, you have a person who's 30 years old</p>
<p class="body">They they have a history of trauma in their life</p>
<p class="body">They're very unhappy, very depressed</p>
<p class="body">Maybe they're Alcoholics they're trying to get their life in order</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See see today</p>
<p class="body">Today I want you to understand this</p>
<p class="body">The user foundation and you know engineering process that we're doing around the world</p>
<p class="body">In 2021, I think 2020 or 2021. I think it's 2021</p>
<p class="body">Our video views are 2.2 billion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
2.2 billion video views</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes why? Because it's worked</p>
<p class="body">And we we have ours</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because 'cause what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It has worked</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying for people, yeah, we have over 16 million volunteers working with the foundation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">It's worked</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Why are they doing this? </p>
<p class="body">Because the only reason is it has worked</p>
<p class="body">What is it that's worked? </p>
<p class="body">I did not teach them a morality</p>
<p class="body">I did not teach them a philosophy</p>
<p class="body">I did not promise them miracles</p>
<p class="body">I did not pull gold chains out of thin air and give it to them</p>
<p class="body">No, nothing, simply tools to fix themselves</p>
<p class="body">Well, just how to sit? </p>
<p class="body">How to breathe? </p>
<p class="body">How to manage yourself this is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All, yes, you're entertaining</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, that's also one of the reasons why you have that many viewers</p>
<p class="body">How many views do we have? </p>
<p class="body">View a guest</p>
<p class="body">Please pull your mic down</p>
<p class="body">So we can hear you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">On YouTube I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Guess yeah, let's just go with you</p>
<p class="body">Tube no, no, it's OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's not the point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All told, how many views? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, I don't know, say 4 billion</p>
<p class="body">It's OK</p>
<p class="body">No, no, probably about the same sounds about right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, and we don't</p>
<p class="body">We're not teaching you **** 
<p class="body">No, that's not true</p>
<p class="body">Other people are that are on here, but I I think that I I see what you're saying that it works</p>
<p class="body">But what I'm saying is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, why it works is not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What are those tools? </p>
<p class="body">This is all very like mystical and difficult for people to grasp</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, no no. It's</p>
<p class="body">There are there are mystical aspects also, but that is not for everybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">But I mean this conversation is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That is only for those who are interested in those things who want to pursue that aspect for the rest of the people</p>
<p class="body">For somebody, if they're back back, it goes away, his life changes for somebody</p>
<p class="body">If his headache goes away, his</p>
<p class="body">Life changes, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Somebody drops his alcohol consumption addiction</p>
<p class="body">His life changes</p>
<p class="body">Yeah somebody, some compulsive thought that maybe drives him crazy</p>
<p class="body">If that goes away, these are simple things</p>
<p class="body">These are just a small screwdriver is all he needs</p>
<p class="body">He doesn't need a total</p>
<p class="body">Overhaul mysticism is a different aspect</p>
<p class="body">It is like</p>
<p class="body">You're not just interested in living well, you want to know the very root of life</p>
<p class="body">Yes, that's a different aspect</p>
<p class="body">That's not for everybody that is only for those who seek that, but for common people all they want to do is they want to live peacefully, joyfully, with some sense of purpose to whatever they are doing in their lives</p>
<p class="body">For this it's very simple</p>
<p class="body">You're talking about a case of a 30 year person and 30 year old person who has this problem this problem</p>
<p class="body">This problem, yeah, I have millions of them with me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Sure you did</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm thirty 4060 all kinds from 16 to any age. Alright, so if we did not work, they wouldn't be working for the foundation we are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We are. We are a volunteer organization with 5600 full time volunteers and over 16 million part time volunteers. Everything is done by volunteers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, obviously you're doing something right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's working, that's all I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Saying So what is it? </p>
<p class="body">When you say it is working</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, people don't know how to sit right</p>
<p class="body">People don't know how to eat, what to eat, when to eat</p>
<p class="body">They don't know</p>
<p class="body">They're just eating like instinctively</p>
<p class="body">See instinctive existence would be fine if you had the intelligence of an animal with this level of intelligence</p>
<p class="body">If you function instinctively, you will be destructive to yourself and to everybody around you</p>
<p class="body">That's what is happening in the world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Instinctively is fine if you have an animal, well, I'll listen</p>
<p class="body">I have an animal and if I left a lot of food around he would just eat himself to death</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Animals, yeah</p>
<p class="body">They won't do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That my dog would</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Say dog has become like you</p>
<p class="body">Inspired by you</p>
<p class="body">But if wild animal wild animal eat what it wants and then it'll move on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a problem, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's true, that's true</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, humans have really messed dogs up</p>
<p class="body">They've turned them into people</p>
<p class="body">Dogs are actually the the human version</p>
<p class="body">Of animals</p>
<p class="body">So when you say it works, though like for a person that is listening to this that is seeking some sort of a path to a better life, what would you recommend they do first? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">The simplest thing they need to understand is human experiences caused from within, not from outside right now, see</p>
<p class="body">Somebody can abuse you</p>
<p class="body">Let's say they're just words</p>
<p class="body">Right now I'm going to abuse you in a language that you don't understand</p>
<p class="body">India has 1300 languages I can choose, yeah</p>
<p class="body">You know India? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
1300 
<p class="body">Wow, I didn't know that wow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So I'm going to use some Indian language and abuse you with a smile on my face</p>
<p class="body">OK, you think I'm saying something very sweet to you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Go ahead</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, so my abuse is not hurting you at all</p>
<p class="body">It's only your reaction which is going to hurt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You got it right, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So in whichever language, it is, whatever nonsense it is</p>
<p class="body">It is only your reaction which hurts you</p>
<p class="body">Not my words ever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But you think my words are hurting you? </p>
<p class="body">This you must change within you</p>
<p class="body">You need to understand it's your compulsive reaction to life which hurts you, not what other people are doing</p>
<p class="body">If somebody hurts you physically, that's a different matter</p>
<p class="body">It's a survival issue</p>
<p class="body">You need to take care of that properly</p>
<p class="body">OK, physical hurt is different</p>
<p class="body">Physical pain is actually very good for you, because if there's yes I'll come</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Circle pains good for you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If there was no physical pain, most people would not know how to survive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They wouldn't know what not</p>
<p class="body">To do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, in the name of T, even though there is so much pain</p>
<p class="body">See how tattooed people are, how poked up they are all over</p>
<p class="body">If there was no pain, yeah, they've got all kinds of holes all over the place</p>
<p class="body">All right, it hurts</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying I'm not commenting on their fashion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">No no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm saying it hurts, yes, but in spite of that they're doing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I know what you're saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If there was no pain at all</p>
<p class="body">They would have pulled out their intestines and walk on the street like</p>
<p class="body">A handbag all right? </p>
<p class="body">Probably yes</p>
<p class="body">If there was no pain, people would not even know how to survive</p>
<p class="body">So in that sense, pain is good for them</p>
<p class="body">It prevents them from doing something absolutely destructive towards themselves</p>
<p class="body">So physical pain is a survival mechanism</p>
<p class="body">That's a different aspect, but rest of the pain is caused in their own mind</p>
<p class="body">Can I? </p>
<p class="body">I can cause physical pain to you, but can I cause mental pain to you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You can initiate something that might make me react</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, I will do nonsense</p>
<p class="body">Alright, I will do total nonsense, but it's you who causes that pain within yourself by reacting in a certain</p>
<p class="body">Way so if I</p>
<p class="body">Initiate things in a language that you don't understand</p>
<p class="body">You're just fine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Then it doesn't work right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Alright, so it is not my words or my actions which are causing pain to you</p>
<p class="body">It's your compulsive reaction which is causing that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This is a</p>
<p class="body">Beautiful concept but for a lot of people they develop these patterns of behavior and thinking that are very difficult to break</p>
<p class="body">So how does one come up with the practices that would allow them to consistently and continually understand this and apply this to their life? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, the patterns are formed</p>
<p class="body">Not only in the psychological structure, the patterns are formed in the chemical structure of the body</p>
<p class="body">The patterns are formed in the energy structures of the body</p>
<p class="body">The patterns are formed in the karmic structures of 1 system, so the memory patterns establish themselves in every way and make you that kind of person</p>
<p class="body">All right, but that that kind of person you are is something that you created unconsciously</p>
<p class="body">If you can create something unconsciously, you can also create the same thing consciously, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you can fix the same thing consciously, you mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I'm saying if you create one kind of persona</p>
<p class="body">Unconsciously, you can also create another kind of persona consciously isn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes you can make a conscious choice to create a healthy persona</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It, but if it's possible, yes</p>
<p class="body">So right now, because the patterns patterns are so well established is like a rut, industrial Rd all right</p>
<p class="body">If there is a deep rut in the road, even if you steer it this way, it drags you that way</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so that is what is happening in people because they have formed patterns, strong patterns, even if they once in a way think oh I must give up the drink</p>
<p class="body">They come off for two days and again they slip back into the same thing</p>
<p class="body">Because there is a chemical pattern, there is a karmic pattern</p>
<p class="body">There is a psychological pattern</p>
<p class="body">There is a compulsiveness built into the body itself</p>
<p class="body">The whole system, so that is working that way</p>
<p class="body">There are various tools and technologies as to how to break these patterns, but they must be willing to subject themselves</p>
<p class="body">You can't force them to do it</p>
<p class="body">It is not something by force</p>
<p class="body">It can only be done when somebody is willing when they have a genuine desire, then there are tools</p>
<p class="body">If you don't have the desire, even if I give you the screwdriver, you'll turn it the wrong way and tighten it further</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Saying right, I see what you're saying so</p>
<p class="body">What actions should someone take besides recognizing that the way they react to things is a conscious choice that they choose to either be upset or not, be upset, or to react to these external no? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, don't go there</p>
<p class="body">Don't go there</p>
<p class="body">Don't go there, see upset, not upset</p>
<p class="body">That is not</p>
<p class="body">The point no</p>
<p class="body">Are you a conscious response or are you an unconscious compulsive reaction? </p>
<p class="body">This is the only thing, reaction or response response means</p>
<p class="body">Right now I say something</p>
<p class="body">That you may not like</p>
<p class="body">Now you can respond the way you want, not because of what I said</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You continue to say what you want</p>
<p class="body">This is your response</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You don't have to react</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you react</p>
<p class="body">You in some way unknowingly you become enslaved to me, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what a lot of people love to do, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, they they always reacting yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's why they start fights</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They think reacting is the way</p>
<p class="body">To live, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Well, if you react, you become somebody slave, I must</p>
<p class="body">I must tell you this on a certain day I Yogi was coming this way coming to Joe Rogan show</p>
<p class="body">On the way somebody stopped him on the street and have used him in every possible way</p>
<p class="body">He listened to everything carefully</p>
<p class="body">Not ignoring them</p>
<p class="body">Listening to very alert, listening to every word of abuse</p>
<p class="body">Then he looked at the time and</p>
<p class="body">He said, see</p>
<p class="body">I have a show I need to go</p>
<p class="body">I finished that and come back</p>
<p class="body">If you have something more to say, you can tell me then</p>
<p class="body">Now these guys don't know what to do with him</p>
<p class="body">These are that kind of people</p>
<p class="body">They will say 100 things if you say one thing they will</p>
<p class="body">Next thing is they'll beat you</p>
<p class="body">But now if you say 100 things, he says he'll come back for more. You don't know what to do with him</p>
<p class="body">Why he's like this? </p>
<p class="body">He's he's decided that he is the master</p>
<p class="body">Of his destiny</p>
<p class="body">No matter who does what, he will go where he wants to go</p>
<p class="body">Intelligent man or no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">A man who goes where he wants to go no matter what anybody else is doing to him</p>
<p class="body">That is, a smart man isn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It it's definitely a better choice than just being a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Reactionary if your reaction you will go away their way</p>
<p class="body">Yes, somebody will take you their way</p>
<p class="body">Somebody will take you this way</p>
<p class="body">Somebody will take you that way</p>
<p class="body">Such a person</p>
<p class="body">Will they ever achieve anything that they wish</p>
<p class="body">To in their life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They might get lucky</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See those those who achieve things by luck</p>
<p class="body">Always live with the fear of losing</p>
<p class="body">It yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They panic, right? </p>
<p class="body">And they're always worried and they they get greedy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Because they're scared</p>
<p class="body">This came by chance and it may go away by chance</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They have famine mentality</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, if if you have, if you've done it by knowing what you're doing</p>
<p class="body">If you lose everything today, you can create it again because you know the mechanics of how to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do right and likely you won't lose it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You won't lose it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah so</p>
<p class="body">What should a person do? </p>
<p class="body">Should they start taking yoga? </p>
<p class="body">Should they start thinking a certain way every day about their life and the way they're responding to things, and whether or not they're reacting or being conscious? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Is that guy falling off the sky or is he doing yoga in your studio? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He's getting abducted by a UFO</p>
<p class="body">That's, uh, that's a flying saucer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I get</p>
<p class="body">I do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You what do you think about flying saucers? </p>
<p class="body">What do you think about like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I will come, let's do yoga first</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">We'll get to that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We'll get to that OK</p>
<p class="body">So right now we're trying to fix the soil to another place</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Now I'm excited</p>
<p class="body">Project let's go with yoga first</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So the word yoga</p>
<p class="body">In United States it scares me</p>
<p class="body">Micos here yoga means you must look like a leftover noodle twisted out like this like that right? </p>
<p class="body">The word yoga means union</p>
<p class="body">Union Union means right now we were talking about the soil as you sit here, you are just</p>
<p class="body">An outcrop of soil you may not realize this because you're sitting on a chair</p>
<p class="body">You're wearing shoes, and because you can prance around</p>
<p class="body">But if you were made like a tree, you would clearly understand you are part of</p>
<p class="body">The soil isn't it, yes? </p>
<p class="body">Or most people will understand when you bury them</p>
<p class="body">Then they know they're part of the soil</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise, they just don't know that they're part of the soil they think they came from somewhere</p>
<p class="body">A lot of people started talking, I'm</p>
<p class="body">From some other planet, this talk is also going on, but essentially</p>
<p class="body">You are part of this, but you are not experiencing it that way</p>
<p class="body">This is not only true with soil, this is true with the entire creation</p>
<p class="body">With the cosmos itself</p>
<p class="body">Today, modern science has come to this that as you sit here, every subatomic particle in your body is actually in communication with everything else</p>
<p class="body">Is this an image of Cosmos that you have? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Sort of just random stars, and occasionally you'll see a shooting star</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So it is this is a</p>
<p class="body">Part of everything, yes</p>
<p class="body">If you don't go want to go that far, at least this is a part of the planet</p>
<p class="body">There is no question about that</p>
<p class="body">That's very clear</p>
<p class="body">But such an experience is not there</p>
<p class="body">If can I tell you my how this happened to me, yes</p>
<p class="body">So when I was four or five years of age</p>
<p class="body">I suddenly realized I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">I don't know anything means I don't know anything at all</p>
<p class="body">I look at a glass of water</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what this is</p>
<p class="body">I know I can drink it</p>
<p class="body">I know in how many ways I can use it, but I don't</p>
<p class="body">Know what it is</p>
<p class="body">Even today, with so much scientific exploration, we still do not know one atom in its entirety</p>
<p class="body">We know how to use it</p>
<p class="body">We know how to break it, we know how to fuse it, we know how to make a bomb out of</p>
<p class="body">It, but we don't know what it is</p>
<p class="body">Even today we don't know what</p>
<p class="body">It is</p>
<p class="body">So if I found a leaf, I'm just staring at it for 5-6 hours at a stretch. If I sit up in the bed, I'm just staring at the darkness for the whole night</p>
<p class="body">My dear father, being a physician started thinking I need some psychiatric evaluation</p>
<p class="body">He started saying this boy is staring at something all the time</p>
<p class="body">It looks like he's lost it</p>
<p class="body">My problem is I'm looking at this</p>
<p class="body">I still don't know what this is</p>
<p class="body">I'm not able to shift my attention to anything else</p>
<p class="body">In this condition they send me to school</p>
<p class="body">My mother said don't look here in there</p>
<p class="body">Pay attention to the teacher</p>
<p class="body">So I went and paid attention to the teacher, the kind of attention they would have never received in their entire life</p>
<p class="body">I'm paying absolute attention to the teacher</p>
<p class="body">Initially, I kind of understood what they were trying to say, but after some time I realized</p>
<p class="body">That they're just making noises</p>
<p class="body">I'm making up the meanings in my mind even now</p>
<p class="body">It is so, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Language is a conspiracy between two people</p>
<p class="body">The moment I talk another language you, I'm just making sounds as far as you're concerned</p>
<p class="body">So when I just heard they're just making sounds, I'm the one who's making up the meanings</p>
<p class="body">I stopped making meanings hour after about teacher after teacher</p>
<p class="body">They come and make noises and noises and noises and go</p>
<p class="body">It became so amusing to me a big smile spread on my face</p>
<p class="body">They were not amused at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you were five when this? </p>
<p class="body">Was happening, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They sent me to school when I was three and a half</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did this accelerate over time? </p>
<p class="body">Did it start off slowly and come? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, the The thing is I don't know one thing from the other</p>
<p class="body">I look at the sky</p>
<p class="body">Tremendous things</p>
<p class="body">I look at it tree</p>
<p class="body">I see every leaf and it drives me crazy</p>
<p class="body">I can't figure out where this coming from what's happening, endless amount of things</p>
<p class="body">If I look at a Pebble, I'll keep on looking at it for hours because I don't know what</p>
<p class="body">It is because there is so much to it</p>
<p class="body">If you take an atom, you can spend a lifetime looking at it, still not knowing what it is</p>
<p class="body">That's the nature of the creation</p>
<p class="body">All right? </p>
<p class="body">It's that complex</p>
<p class="body">So my schooling went on like this and</p>
<p class="body">I slowly started going there only when it was absolutely necessary, otherwise I had my own excursions going</p>
<p class="body">So about 11-12 years ago this school where I studied over 50 years ago, they come to me and say, sadhguru, you must come. It is our 125th anniversary of the school. You must come and speak</p>
<p class="body">I said, see</p>
<p class="body">Why me? </p>
<p class="body">Because I was not just a not good student</p>
<p class="body">I was not even a student</p>
<p class="body">I was barely there, why? </p>
<p class="body">Why are you asking me to come? </p>
<p class="body">I'm not a good example for any of your students</p>
<p class="body">They said no</p>
<p class="body">Our school has produced ministers</p>
<p class="body">Our school has produced cricketing stars, sports stars, film stars</p>
<p class="body">You are the only Mystic so you must come</p>
<p class="body">It's so I went</p>
<p class="body">I went and stood up to speak in the same quadrangle, the oppressive buildings around me</p>
<p class="body">And I looked at this classroom and I suddenly remembered and I narrated this to them</p>
<p class="body">See, I was around 12 years of age</p>
<p class="body">And one teacher came, and those days, because I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">What's there to talk for days on end? </p>
<p class="body">I don't utter a word, I just go to the sports field</p>
<p class="body">I play intensely any game that is there and classroom home</p>
<p class="body">I don't say a thing because I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">So what is there to say? </p>
<p class="body">So this teacher is asking me some question</p>
<p class="body">I'm looking at him</p>
<p class="body">I know his past, present and future sitting there, but I don't know what he's talking about</p>
<p class="body">Initially I hear the words after some time I'm just seeing him like a blob of energy like that, and I know that guy through and through, but I don't know what he's talking about, 3540 minutes. He tried to get an answer from me</p>
<p class="body">I didn't say nothing</p>
<p class="body">So he came help me with the shoulder shook me violently like this and said you must be either the divine or the devil</p>
<p class="body">I think you're the latter</p>
<p class="body">So till then my problem was I didn't know what is this</p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">But it was clear this was me</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly this guy confused me about this</p>
<p class="body">Also, I looked at myself</p>
<p class="body">What is this? </p>
<p class="body">Is this divine devil? </p>
<p class="body">What the hell is this? </p>
<p class="body">This question had never come to me till I was twelve</p>
<p class="body">I had a question about everything in the universe</p>
<p class="body">But this was clear</p>
<p class="body">This was me</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly this guy confused me about this also</p>
<p class="body">Then I tried to stare at myself</p>
<p class="body">It didn't work</p>
<p class="body">I started closing my eyes</p>
<p class="body">And initially it started with minutes</p>
<p class="body">It went into hours</p>
<p class="body">It went into days</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes I just close my eyes and sat for days</p>
<p class="body">On end</p>
<p class="body">This changed the whole experience of my life when I was 25. I just burst into an experience where</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly every cell in my body was dripping ecstasy like that</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly, yeah, I was sitting on a rock and just I burst out like this for the first time in my life</p>
<p class="body">Adult life tears were coming</p>
<p class="body">Tears and me were impossible</p>
<p class="body">I lived like that</p>
<p class="body">So I was just wondering what's happening when I I thought it's 1015 minutes when I came out it was 4 1/2 hours. My shirt was wet with tears</p>
<p class="body">That what's happening to me</p>
<p class="body">Am I going off the rocker or something? </p>
<p class="body">That's the only thing my skeptical mind could tell me because I was a super skeptic about everything in the universe</p>
<p class="body">I had a question about everything about the family structure about the social society, about religion, about politics, about economics, about everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So what do you think was happening? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll tell you then</p>
<p class="body">I talked to my closest friends</p>
<p class="body">Hey, something is happening to me, I'm just</p>
<p class="body">Blissed out, you know if I just talk to them tears are coming to me</p>
<p class="body">I said what's happening to you, man</p>
<p class="body">You, what did you drink? </p>
<p class="body">What did you pop? </p>
<p class="body">This is a question then I knew there was no context to my experience, so I spent started spending more and more time by myself</p>
<p class="body">And I realized if I just take my hands off my mind completely</p>
<p class="body">Then I see that every cell in my body just bursts out with blissfulness</p>
<p class="body">Then I established this properly within myself</p>
<p class="body">How to do that? </p>
<p class="body">Then I sat down and made a plan</p>
<p class="body">At that time, the world's population was 5.6 billion people. I made a plan in 2 1/2 years time. I will make the whole world ecstatic here. I am 40 years later</p>
<p class="body">It took me time to realize people are so deeply invested in their miseries that even if you offer them the best thing, they will go round and round and round around that not getting the point because they're too deeply invested in something they don't realize as you sit here</p>
<p class="body">And through your misery or joy, life is slipping away</p>
<p class="body">Every heartbeat is life going away, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's not the clock ticking</p>
<p class="body">It is life ticking away as we sit here moment by moment we're getting closer to our grave people don't understand they're mortal</p>
<p class="body">This is the biggest problem on a daily basis</p>
<p class="body">They're not conscious that as I sit here, my time is running out</p>
<p class="body">I need to make the best</p>
<p class="body">Out of this</p>
<p class="body">If I'm conscious that I'm mortal if I know my time is running out, I would keep myself in the best possible way</p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't have time to quarrel with somebody I wouldn't have time to do nasty things to somebody or to myself</p>
<p class="body">I would do the best to myself unnaturally when you're feeling wonderful</p>
<p class="body">You do wonderful things to everybody around you, a happy person or very joyful person is naturally a pleasant person to everybody</p>
<p class="body">When you're feeling nasty, you will share it with people</p>
<p class="body">Of course the same nastiness</p>
<p class="body">So this process I decided we must somehow share this with people</p>
<p class="body">So I started building devices</p>
<p class="body">I was practicing yoga since I was 12 years of age</p>
<p class="body">A simple form of yoga that also I got in for all the wrong reasons</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All the wrong reasons</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, in the sense I was around 11-12 years of age this was my</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The story about the well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know the story, so I got in for the wrong reason, thinking I'll become a superhuman like him</p>
<p class="body">But it is something else to me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The story to people so they hear it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know this is a ancestral home where we are about 3536 of Cousin Brothers and sisters who live in different cities</p>
<p class="body">We all come and converge in our ancestral home for the summer vacation, usually 30 to 45 days Max</p>
<p class="body">So it's 1 rollicking place</p>
<p class="body">All the kids totally out of control and doing all kinds of things</p>
<p class="body">The young boys</p>
<p class="body">One of the things is there's a drinking water well in the backyard, which is about 8-8 feet in diameter, about 150 feet in depth</p>
<p class="body">In summer months, when we go there, it's at least 6070 feet below the ground level. The water</p>
<p class="body">So we jump into this</p>
<p class="body">Well you have to go straight</p>
<p class="body">If you go this way your brain will become a smear on the wall actually</p>
<p class="body">You have to go straight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did that ever happen? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's happened to other people, not to me</p>
<p class="body">My brains are still here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You people who died</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Know no, not in our house</p>
<p class="body">It didn't happen</p>
<p class="body">It's happened to other boys, yeah</p>
<p class="body">And when you want to come up, there is no step or anything</p>
<p class="body">You just have to hold the</p>
<p class="body">Rock and come up</p>
<p class="body">You know you're just about 1 centimeter</p>
<p class="body">Half an inch is what you have in the rock</p>
<p class="body">Your entire weight is on these four fingers, so your nails will start bleeding out of sheer pressure so I could come up pretty well</p>
<p class="body">I was</p>
<p class="body">Coming up very well on out of that, so I'm very proud and I can do it better than people</p>
<p class="body">So one day we are doing this act and a man who is over 70 years of age was watching us without a word</p>
<p class="body">He just walked and jumped into the well</p>
<p class="body">I thought the old guys finished</p>
<p class="body">But he came up faster than me</p>
<p class="body">I didn't like it</p>
<p class="body">I said how? </p>
<p class="body">He said, come into yoga so I followed him like a puppy so I got into yoga for all the wrong reasons</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying this because even for wrong reasons, if you do the right things right, things will happen to you</p>
<p class="body">This is a beauty about this world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this was how old we at the</p>
<p class="body">Time to have</p>
<p class="body">So this was along the same time that you were having these realizations about the nature of things</p>
<p class="body">It was they all sort of came together like it's a very fortuitous sort of convergence</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When I look back and I look back, it's all like a set plan all right</p>
<p class="body">At that time it was all wonderful accidents happening, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a thing that happens though sometimes right when you're on the right path, like wonderful accidents do sort of seem to happen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See The thing is just this</p>
<p class="body">If you're designed to fly</p>
<p class="body">If something is designed to fly</p>
<p class="body">If the stronger the wind is, the higher it flies you know</p>
<p class="body">I'm a licensed helicopter pilot</p>
<p class="body">Oh really</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, everybody thinks winds are a bad thing</p>
<p class="body">No winds are great only when you're landing</p>
<p class="body">If it's cross wind, it's a little bit of a issue otherwise</p>
<p class="body">Without headwind you can't really fly</p>
<p class="body">Alright too much</p>
<p class="body">A storm is a different thing, but headwinds are good</p>
<p class="body">That's why the airplane flies alright</p>
<p class="body">It's because of that there is aerodynamics and it flies</p>
<p class="body">So if your design to fly this is what is important</p>
<p class="body">What yoga means is you get yourself geometrically correct</p>
<p class="body">What being genetically correct means is see every physical creation in the universe has a geometry to it</p>
<p class="body">If the geometry is in such a way that it has least amount of friction</p>
<p class="body">Then it functions at its best</p>
<p class="body">When would you say? </p>
<p class="body">Suppose you start your car engine and he said cut, cut, cut, cut, cut</p>
<p class="body">Would you say this is well engineered car? </p>
<p class="body">You start it, you don't even know you can't feel the engine</p>
<p class="body">Then you said this is a good car because it's only unless you make it roar</p>
<p class="body">You can't feel the engine</p>
<p class="body">That means everything is going smoothly with least amount of friction, so it is a geometric perfection which does this</p>
<p class="body">So everything that is physical in the universe needs</p>
<p class="body">A certain perfection of geometry to function at a certain level of competence</p>
<p class="body">So this geometry</p>
<p class="body">Today there is something called as constructional theory</p>
<p class="body">They're making it yogic sciences are deeply invested in this</p>
<p class="body">That is how an atom is made, how an amoeba is made, a single celled Organism is made</p>
<p class="body">How you are made, how the universe is made</p>
<p class="body">The fundamental design is not different</p>
<p class="body">It's the same design</p>
<p class="body">The complexity and sophistication is multiplying many, many fold, but essentially it's the same design</p>
<p class="body">So this is what today we're calling as the carbon chain on this planet</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's a microorganism or a tree or the atmosphere or the water or a human being, everything is 1 chain</p>
<p class="body">If you break one link, everything could collapse on your head</p>
<p class="body">You know that's what we're talking about when we talk about soil</p>
<p class="body">One link has become very weak if we don't strengthen that</p>
<p class="body">The entire chain could collapse</p>
<p class="body">Because a chain is as strong as a individual link, and this one link of the soil has become super thin, if you push it any further the whole thing, the very chain of life could collapse</p>
<p class="body">So it is the geometry which keeps it going</p>
<p class="body">For example, this planet is going around the sun</p>
<p class="body">There is no titanium, titanium chain or a cable holding it to the sun and</p>
<p class="body">Swinging it around, it's just a perfection of geometry</p>
<p class="body">If you just get it off its path finished, it'll fly off somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">It'll burn itself out only because of certain geometries</p>
<p class="body">Hit a certain geometry, they're all</p>
<p class="body">There look like perpetual machines</p>
<p class="body">They're not perpetual</p>
<p class="body">In our experience, they're perpetual because our life span is so small, but otherwise it's not perpetual</p>
<p class="body">At one time it was not there at some time</p>
<p class="body">In future, if it will not be there again, that's a different matter, but right now it is hit a certain geometric perfection that it keeps going as if it's forever</p>
<p class="body">So yoga 1 aspect of yoga</p>
<p class="body">Is this</p>
<p class="body">To get your body to a geometrically congruent state with the rest of the creation</p>
<p class="body">If you are geometrically congruent, suddenly your experience is not that of an individual, but that of being universal</p>
<p class="body">So to put it very, very simply it's like this</p>
<p class="body">See, we can do an experiment, can we? </p>
<p class="body">Just put your hands together with your eyes closed</p>
<p class="body">What you do is you rub your hands very briskly for 30 seconds</p>
<p class="body">Now hold it three or four</p>
<p class="body">Inches away from each other</p>
<p class="body">Something happening between them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Don't you feel something? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I feel the heat of each hand</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Not the heat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is it warm from friction? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Now, isn't there a sensation between them? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<p class="body">So right now see right now what is the difference between you and the chair on which you're sitting? </p>
<p class="body">It's only the sensations which tells you how do you know this is me? </p>
<p class="body">This is not me right here</p>
<p class="body">There are sensations here, no sensations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So essentially what you call as myself is a certain boundary of sensations</p>
<p class="body">It's essentially boundary which determines what is you and what is not</p>
<p class="body">You isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, this water, is it you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Will become me when I drink it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you put it into the boundaries of your sensation, it becomes you</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and that's how this whole thing has come right when you were born</p>
<p class="body">You were this much now you become this much. It's the food that you've eaten water that you took and everything into the boundaries of your sensation. Now you experience it as myself, 100%. So if you lose 10 kilograms</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Would you think that 10 kilograms of me is gone? </p>
<p class="body">No, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, what if you look in the mirror? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no in your experience</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Your experience is exactly the same except</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Exactly the same because what is in within the boundaries of your sensation is you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Maybe you feel healthier</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you do anything vigorous or intense, suddenly the boundaries of your sensation is breached and you experience something more</p>
<p class="body">Why there is such a big draw? </p>
<p class="body">Towards sexuality or people are rubbing each other all the time</p>
<p class="body">Is just this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Rubbing each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know way</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying it is because somewhere for one moment they are something more than what they are, somebody or something which is not themselves becomes a part of them, at least for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">A moment yes</p>
<p class="body">This breaching of sensory boundary is yoga</p>
<p class="body">If you sit here and if you can spread your sensory body as big as this room, you would experience everything in this room as yourself</p>
<p class="body">See right now your heart, your liver, your kidney, the five fingers of your hand</p>
<p class="body">This was not you some time ago, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">You and you are a baby</p>
<p class="body">Your finger was this much now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It became this much</p>
<p class="body">That means these fingers, the way they are</p>
<p class="body">They were not you just some time ago, but today they 100% you isn't it? How did this happen? Because this material got accumulated within the sense boundaries of your sensory body sensory body</p>
<p class="body">If you make yourself exuberant, either because of joy or blissfulness, sensory body expands</p>
<p class="body">If you expand your body in such a way, it's as big as the universe</p>
<p class="body">You will experience the whole universe as yourself</p>
<p class="body">This is yoga</p>
<p class="body">So the twisting turning holding the breath, doing this, doing that all these things are to loosen up the body in such a way that your physical body and your sensory body are</p>
<p class="body">Not stuck to each other, sensory body can expand today, you know if somebody lost a limb or something</p>
<p class="body">They have something called as a phantom leg</p>
<p class="body">Even if the leg is gone, they're still experiencing the leg because the sensory body is still not there</p>
<p class="body">So essentially physical body is acting like a scaffolding for the sensory body, which gives the experience of life</p>
<p class="body">If your sensory body was totally dead, you wouldn't experience anything, even if you had your body alright</p>
<p class="body">So if your sensory body expands, you'll experience this whole room or this building, or this town as yourself</p>
<p class="body">So this is what yoga means</p>
<p class="body">This is the purpose of yoga because once you experience somebody or something as a part of yourself</p>
<p class="body">Nobody has to teach you any morality</p>
<p class="body">Be good, don't harm them</p>
<p class="body">Don't do this</p>
<p class="body">Don't do that</p>
<p class="body">These teachings will be irrelevant for you, because anything that nobody ever taught you</p>
<p class="body">This little finger don't bite it off</p>
<p class="body">It is a poor little finger</p>
<p class="body">Nobody had to tell you this because it's you write what you experience as myself</p>
<p class="body">With that you have no conflict</p>
<p class="body">This is what yoga means. The mechanism of getting there. There are various mechanisms. There are actually 112</p>
<p class="body">Proper technologies as to how one can get into that space</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
112 You talked about in your book that I was reading. You talked about the the different kinds of yoga and you told a very funny story about God getting them all together</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">The four yogis? Yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Dude, you mind telling that what? </p>
<p class="body">What are the different types of yoga there's? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Say you can do employ your body and perform action and do yoga</p>
<p class="body">This is karma yoga</p>
<p class="body">Karma means action using action to attain unity</p>
<p class="body">With the existence</p>
<p class="body">If you use your intelligence to get attain unity with the existence, then it is called as Nana Yoga, yoga, intelligence</p>
<p class="body">If you use your emotion to get there, that is called as bhakti yoga</p>
<p class="body">Yoga of devotion or emotion</p>
<p class="body">And if you use your energies by refining and expanding your energies, if you do it, that is called as Kriya yoga</p>
<p class="body">The Science and technology of expanding one's energies. So these are the only four ways you can do because these are only four things you have</p>
<p class="body">Rest is all imagination</p>
<p class="body">We have a body, you have a mind</p>
<p class="body">You have emotions and you have energies</p>
<p class="body">Life energies within you</p>
<p class="body">Beyond this rest is all made up in terms of your beliefs and imaginations</p>
<p class="body">These are the four realities you can only work with what you have</p>
<p class="body">You cannot work with what you don't have, so these four things</p>
<p class="body">Is there anybody who is only body, no mind, no emotion, no energy or only mind, not the other three? </p>
<p class="body">All of us are a combination of the</p>
<p class="body">Four, it's just</p>
<p class="body">That in one person, the body may be dominant in another person</p>
<p class="body">The mind may be dominant in another person</p>
<p class="body">Emotion like this, different combinations of the same four ingredients are there in different human beings and different persons</p>
<p class="body">So accordingly, yoga has to be mixed</p>
<p class="body">This is why the significance in the Eastern cultures of having</p>
<p class="body">A live guru? </p>
<p class="body">Who's looking at you and making the right concoction? </p>
<p class="body">Let's say you came to me when you were 20</p>
<p class="body">Naturally, your body would be very dominant</p>
<p class="body">We would give you one type of yoga</p>
<p class="body">Now you returned when you're 40</p>
<p class="body">Now maybe your mind is more dominant</p>
<p class="body">Maybe your emotion is more dominant</p>
<p class="body">Maybe energy is more dominant</p>
<p class="body">Body could have receded a little</p>
<p class="body">Bit so accordingly it has to be mixed so it is not like a common prescription</p>
<p class="body">Everybody do this, everybody do</p>
<p class="body">This is not going to work</p>
<p class="body">It needs to be mixed the right way</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise, it won't work</p>
<p class="body">This is one reason a whole lot of people on the spiritual path feel first three months</p>
<p class="body">They seem to be going somewhere after that they are stagnant because nobody to gauge that and you know tweak that thing according to their needs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So they need a guru</p>
<p class="body">They need someone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">To see the word guru is a</p>
4 letter word today in America</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, because they are fake ones, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's why that's why I'm a Satguru. It has 88 alphabets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Will you tell the story about God getting all the girls together? </p>
<p class="body">All the different types of yogis together? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So this is, uh, on a certain day, 4 yogis are walking in the forest</p>
<p class="body">One is a Gnana Yogi yoga of intelligence</p>
<p class="body">Another is a karma Yogi body yoga</p>
<p class="body">Another is Bhakti Yogi emotional and devotional Yogi and other is a Kriya Yogi, master of energies</p>
<p class="body">So suddenly a stomp picks up and they start running to find a shelter</p>
<p class="body">The Bhakti Yogi who has I don't know who knows the geography of temples in the area</p>
<p class="body">He says</p>
<p class="body">Let's go in this direction</p>
<p class="body">There's an ancient temple there, so they all ran there</p>
<p class="body">Then they found an ancient temple where the walls had collapsed long time ago</p>
<p class="body">Just the roof and in the center there's a</p>
<p class="body">Day T they</p>
<p class="body">All rushed into the temple, not out of love for the day T or God</p>
<p class="body">There was no other place to sit, so they all four of them hugged the deity and sat down</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly God appeared</p>
<p class="body">They all wondered why</p>
<p class="body">Now we did so much yoga you didn't come now when we're just escaping the storm, you turn up so they looked at him</p>
<p class="body">Why now? </p>
<p class="body">So God said at last you 4 idiots got together</p>
<p class="body">I've been waiting for this for a long time</p>
<p class="body">Body going One Direction, mind going another direction and emotion another way</p>
<p class="body">How will anything happen? </p>
<p class="body">These four things have to come together</p>
<p class="body">This is very important, but today the way it is happening, the yoga</p>
<p class="body">It's become very more</p>
<p class="body">More like a exercise</p>
<p class="body">If you want exercise, there are so many ways to do it goes</p>
<p class="body">Have a swim</p>
<p class="body">Maybe play tennis, maybe climb a mountain</p>
<p class="body">You'll get much better exercise</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is not for exercise</p>
<p class="body">It will also give you that</p>
<p class="body">It'll give you fitness. Also there are different types of yoga's for fitness. There are certain kind of yoga you must come. We can do this with you. It's called anger mordonna that means mastering your limbs</p>
<p class="body">Without any equipment, you can master your limbs in such a way that you become very resilient. People are asking me, sadhguru, you're 65 years of age</p>
<p class="body">How will you do this 30,000 kilometers on a lone motorcycle yourself riding like this across 26 or 27 countries? </p>
<p class="body">I was just joking with them and I said see this is an advertisement for a yogic back</p>
<p class="body">You will say I will ride</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How did yoga get started? </p>
<p class="body">Like what what do you think was the origin of it? </p>
<p class="body">Because it's an ancient form of</p>
<p class="body">However, you want to call it an ancient practice, like what and it's obviously very beneficial to so many people to practice it</p>
<p class="body">How did it get started? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, there is nothing in the universe which is not yoga</p>
<p class="body">In the sense</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing in the universe which is not one with everything else</p>
<p class="body">Except human mind</p>
<p class="body">This is what we're talking about, soil also</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing on this planet which is unconnected</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing in this solar system unconnected</p>
<p class="body">There's nothing in this universe unconnected, so everything is in yoga</p>
<p class="body">The question is only whether you realize that or not</p>
<p class="body">If you realize that if you experience that, then we call you a Yogi</p>
<p class="body">Yogi means not somebody who is twisting and turning</p>
<p class="body">Yogi means one who is experiencing the Union right now</p>
<p class="body">That though you're an individual, your experience has gone beyond your individual nature you're experiencing</p>
<p class="body">The universality of your existence</p>
<p class="body">Your individual nature is a psychological condition</p>
<p class="body">See physically, this is what we've been talking about</p>
<p class="body">Soil nourishment, everything physically</p>
<p class="body">If people don't understand this, if you close these two holes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In those holes, yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Keep your mouth also close</p>
close this and see if you're not connected with the oxygen bubble around you</p>
<p class="body">You won't exist for two minutes, right? </p>
<p class="body">So where is your individuality? </p>
<p class="body">I'm saying physically</p>
<p class="body">With food, water with everything else, we can say it in so many different ways, but physically you know there is no individuality to your body</p>
<p class="body">Only psychologically, this individual nature we have taken it too seriously simply because it's the magnanimity of creation</p>
<p class="body">That which has given us an individual experience actually</p>
<p class="body">In this cosmos, we are like a speck</p>
<p class="body">If you, if you look at the solar system itself from somewhere</p>
<p class="body">A million light years away, the solar system itself is a tiny spec in that planet</p>
<p class="body">Earth is a micro spec in that micro spec</p>
<p class="body">Texas is a Super Micro spec in that Austin is a super Super Micro spec in that you are a big man</p>
<p class="body">This is a serious problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">You take yourself seriously when you're really connected to everything and you think of yourself as an individual when you're not</p>
<p class="body">You're really a part of everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Your individuality is just a psychological thing, you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Want to see a funny meme that points to that? </p>
<p class="body">I bought that Sam Tripoli meme</p>
<p class="body">Do you, yeah, do you know what? </p>
<p class="body">Memes are, I think so yeah</p>
<p class="body">They're funny things that people, well, it's</p>
<p class="body">It's like a kind of a new form of comedy, but this one relates very closely to what you're saying, and it's this right here</p>
<p class="body">You are here</p>
<p class="body">Crying in the shower before work</p>
<p class="body">Pointing to</p>
<p class="body">The outer regions of the Milky Way Galaxy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, so this tiny micro micro Super Micro spec thinks it's the center of the universe, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Funny, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is serious issue</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a big problem for a lot of people, and you know what's the function of that</p>
<p class="body">So like, why does the human animal think that way, like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See as I said this is the magnanimity of creation</p>
<p class="body">Though you're a tiny speck, you have an individual experience</p>
<p class="body">This is the greatest gift that we have</p>
<p class="body">We can sit here, even wonder about the universe not knowing where it begins, where it ends all right</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so this is a tremendous gift that we have been given an individuality</p>
<p class="body">But you're taking it too seriously for this</p>
<p class="body">The only cure is that you're always conscious that you're mortal</p>
<p class="body">Your time you're on a limited lease of time</p>
<p class="body">If you know this, you will not take your individuality seriously</p>
<p class="body">You will enjoy it</p>
<p class="body">The way it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The problem is our culture</p>
<p class="body">Thrives on individuals taking themselves seriously</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is why</p>
<p class="body">There is the most affluent country on the planet</p>
<p class="body">Look at the amount of miseries people are going through</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's a lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, I remember this</p>
<p class="body">Uh, I was in 98 for the first time when I came to United States</p>
<p class="body">I went there to the US embassy in Chennai to get my visa</p>
<p class="body">So this is you had to at that time you had to go at like 6:30 in the morning</p>
<p class="body">It would start at that time, 7:00 o'clock they will start seeing you</p>
<p class="body">I went there because, you know, the consul general</p>
<p class="body">A fine lady</p>
<p class="body">She had heard about me</p>
<p class="body">So instead of just doing at the counter, she asked me to come to her office</p>
<p class="body">So I went there and there she asked me see, you're going to United States? </p>
<p class="body">We've heard so much about you in India, but you know if you want to teach in the United</p>
<p class="body">States you need</p>
<p class="body">A A teacher</p>
<p class="body">You know yoga teacher certificate</p>
<p class="body">Are you certified? </p>
<p class="body">I said if I had asked for a certification from my guru, you would have cut my throat so I don't have</p>
<p class="body">I live yoga, I don't I don't. I'm not certified. Then we had a long chat and then I was coming out by about maybe 7:45</p>
<p class="body">Then I see outside the US embassy at the outside the compound one young man, young boy like maybe in his early 20s sitting and crying</p>
<p class="body">Literally crying his heart out</p>
<p class="body">I couldn't ignore him</p>
<p class="body">You know my car was already there and</p>
<p class="body">Then I got off the car and went to him and asked, hey what's the problem? </p>
<p class="body">His visa got rejected</p>
<p class="body">The guy so bitter he could kill himself</p>
<p class="body">He's in that kind of condition</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, they didn't</p>
<p class="body">Let you go</p>
<p class="body">So word about it</p>
<p class="body">But that's not how it is</p>
<p class="body">People think going to United States is everything</p>
<p class="body">Ask the people who are living here how</p>
<p class="body">Many complaints they have</p>
<p class="body">They are miserable because they are here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You're not crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what I'm saying, because human misery is not in India or America</p>
<p class="body">It is within you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">One of the things that struck me from your book was that you didn't read a lot of the writings on yoga until you're much older</p>
<p class="body">You were practicing yoga, but you hadn't read</p>
<p class="body">Read any of the ancient texts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I have never read any ancient texts</p>
<p class="body">Not even now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Really, yes, you don't have any desire to find what they were thinking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because my own clarity has never failed me, I don't want to confuse myself because</p>
<p class="body">We don't know in these many thousands of years who all have added whatever nonsense they've added to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You never know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a problem like human beings</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Over period of time you know every scripture has been meddled with by people, but anyway</p>
<p class="body">All scriptures, it doesn't matter where they got the information from, how they received it, but written by human beings or write languages written by human beings</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">All right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's no question</p>
<p class="body">People may say God dictated to me, but still even if I dictate something to you, you can still write it wrong</p>
<p class="body">So I'm saying</p>
<p class="body">Those books I never read</p>
<p class="body">The only book I read is this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Body your soul, your experience you yeah whatever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This this</p>
<p class="body">This this mechanism, which is in my</p>
<p class="body">In my experience, because nothing else is in your experience, just see this</p>
<p class="body">You can't experience what's here</p>
<p class="body">You can only experience what is here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you find that? </p>
<p class="body">That's kind of contradictory in some ways to your existence, because your what you're doing is expressing your experience to other people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, no</p>
<p class="body">I'm not expressing no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You're not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I see some experience</p>
<p class="body">What did that Joe Rogan experience? </p>
<p class="body">Oh OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's the name of the podcast</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So I'm never, you know here and there when people ask questions</p>
<p class="body">I may say something, but as I said, there's no philosophy</p>
<p class="body">There is no teaching</p>
<p class="body">There's no belief system, just methods</p>
<p class="body">Yes, but you sit like this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You've given so much wisdom, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You breathe like this</p>
<p class="body">You do this this and this</p>
<p class="body">This will happen to you</p>
<p class="body">Your experiment</p>
40 days you do it</p>
<p class="body">If it works, you keep it</p>
<p class="body">If it doesn't work</p>
<p class="body">Try it and move</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">On, but do you see that you've written all this down for people to learn from? </p>
<p class="body">No, you haven't</p>
<p class="body">Why did you write it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I have not written down anything what is in the book what is in the book is more like a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You have books</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Brochure a brochure</p>
<p class="body">It's a you know 300 page brochure. Just introducing you, that's not we will never write down what you have to use that has to be transmitted</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, but you are riding your own personal experiences and people benefit from that greatly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That is more for inspiration</p>
<p class="body">A book is for inspiration, not for instruction</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">And you don't think that there's any inspiration to be gleamed from other people's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Experiences. It is, of course</p>
<p class="body">In Spitze, if you're looking for inspiration, is one thing</p>
<p class="body">If you're looking for instruction, don't look in the book</p>
<p class="body">No, no inspiration is different to get you fired up</p>
<p class="body">Once you're fired up, you want to know now</p>
<p class="body">Don't go on reading books that will not get you anywhere</p>
<p class="body">You have to to start delve deeper into yourself</p>
<p class="body">For that we can give you methods how to go deeper</p>
<p class="body">See when I like we were talking</p>
<p class="body">About the screwdriver, yes</p>
<p class="body">How to do the? </p>
<p class="body">Thing you know with the right kind of tool</p>
<p class="body">If you use the wrong kind of tool, I give you a spanner for the screw which is in the furniture</p>
<p class="body">It's not going to help</p>
<p class="body">It's a tool, but it's not going to help the right tool, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's all that is</p>
<p class="body">All my work is to give them the right tool</p>
<p class="body">I will not use the tool for them, they must use it only for a few who completely give themselves for them</p>
<p class="body">I may also turn the screws for them, but largely we just give you the screwdriver</p>
<p class="body">It's up to you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But even when you were younger, you didn't seek inspiration from some other peoples experiences</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Somehow it didn't work like that for me for me</p>
<p class="body">Everything was a question mark</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying if I see a leaf, it's a question</p>
<p class="body">If I see a look at my father, it's a question</p>
<p class="body">If I look at my mother, it's a question they were wonderful loving parents, but I had questions about everything, nothing</p>
<p class="body">Negative, just a question, because question is a tool to dig deeper</p>
<p class="body">Question is a not a way of insulting somebody</p>
<p class="body">I ask you a question</p>
<p class="body">This is not</p>
<p class="body">To corner you to insult you to do something</p>
<p class="body">Question is the only way to dig deeper, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Like you know, like people have their experiences, their opinions about everything in the universe</p>
<p class="body">For example, before coming here, a whole lot of people calling him sadhguru don't go on Joe Rogan show</p>
<p class="body">Why are you going there? </p>
<p class="body">Sadhguru you know what he is</p>
<p class="body">I said whatever he is, let me go and find out what the hell he is</p>
<p class="body">Why are you telling me who he is? </p>
<p class="body">Alright, well no, no</p>
<p class="body">He thinks this</p>
<p class="body">He thinks that well if he thinks I'm a chimpanzee, I will prove I'm a very good one</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying I have worked in prisons</p>
<p class="body">You know, like we have a program called inner freedom for imprison both in United States</p>
<p class="body">We worked, but then we stepped out of US in India. Our programs are mandatory in all the South Indian prisons</p>
<p class="body">Really, yeah, and I worked with really hard code ******** you know criminals who have been convicted for murder and more</p>
<p class="body">They have done terrible things, but when they are with me they are such wonderful guys</p>
<p class="body">Lively and fantastic guys</p>
<p class="body">But if you meet them and they are angry or dissatisfied, they may be terrible if you meet them when they are happy and joyful, they are fantastic people</p>
<p class="body">So I'm saying every human being has opinions about everything</p>
<p class="body">This is one thing I've done in</p>
<p class="body">My life is</p>
<p class="body">People who are with me for 25 thirty 40 years with me right next to me. I've it's very difficult for people to understand this. I have not formed a single opinion about them</p>
<p class="body">Every day I look at them fresh</p>
<p class="body">This is very important, yes, so when I sit here I look at you fresh</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter what you have done because what you are going to be tomorrow is what is important, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When you're experiencing these prisoners, do you think that that's part of the problem? </p>
<p class="body">With having had a horrible past, you know, having been a criminal, having been a murderer is that you can never really get past those experiences, and a lot of people eyes they don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's that's</p>
<p class="body">Not true see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They don't experience you fresh</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">See it see</p>
<p class="body">The societies are made in a certain way where unfortunately certain people can't fit in alright, not necessarily because it's in a very American thing</p>
<p class="body">This is a good guy</p>
<p class="body">This is a bad</p>
<p class="body">Guy, I don't look at life like that</p>
<p class="body">It is just that in a given moment, if somebody makes one wrong judgment, he utters something, or he does something in that moment that may end up in the prison</p>
<p class="body">I've met hundreds of them, thousands of them</p>
<p class="body">Most of them are absolutely wonderful guys</p>
<p class="body">There are few who are mentally pathologically somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">That's different, right? </p>
<p class="body">But rest of them</p>
<p class="body">It's a given moment</p>
<p class="body">They make wrong judgments because that's all they know at that given</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think that the practice of yoga can reform people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh yes, of course I will tell you</p>
<p class="body">I will tell you this</p>
<p class="body">See when I first went into the prison in Coimbatore to teach</p>
<p class="body">Don't mistake me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And it was very difficult to get him</p>
<p class="body">I discovered that</p>
<p class="body">The in the people and the living things around you, including the soil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Essentially it's like this</p>
<p class="body">If you feel pleasant in your body</p>
<p class="body">We call this health</p>
<p class="body">Yes, if you feel very pleasant in your body we call this pleasure</p>
<p class="body">If you feel pleasant in your mind, we call this peace</p>
<p class="body">If you feel very pleasant, we call this joy</p>
<p class="body">If you feel</p>
<p class="body">Very pleasant if you feel pleasant in your emotion</p>
<p class="body">We call this laugh</p>
<p class="body">If you feel very pleasant, we call it compassion</p>
<p class="body">If you feel very pleasant in your very life energies, then we call this blissfulness</p>
<p class="body">If you become very, very pleasant, then we call it ecstasy</p>
<p class="body">If your surroundings become pleasant, we call it success</p>
<p class="body">So to create pleasantness in the surroundings we need the cooperation of people and forces around us. Without everybody's cooperation you can't create a pleasant atmosphere</p>
<p class="body">But pleasantness of the body pleasantness of the mind, pleasantness of emotion and energy is 100% your business</p>
<p class="body">Isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">So if you're feeling ecstatic</p>
<p class="body">You are in heaven</p>
<p class="body">Because your idea</p>
<p class="body">Of heaven is a very pleasant place, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">This place, this planet Earth is very pleasant except for the human beings who creating unpleasantness among each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, this sounds like a great concept, but human beings are very complex</p>
<p class="body">Their emotions or complex, their needs and desires and their trauma and pain and insecurities and and all mental health issues</p>
<p class="body">How does one get to that spot? </p>
<p class="body">Like what you're saying sounds wonderful</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you're a guru</p>
<p class="body">You're a literal guru, so when you sit here and tell people these things, they go well</p>
<p class="body">That sounds easy for that guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, it's it's not easy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Look at</p>
<p class="body">Him, he's wise and enlightened</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not easy or difficult</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He got a great beard</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not easy or difficult</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">It is a question of wrong direction or right direction</p>
<p class="body">That is, you went to an apple tree and you're digging the roots because you're a potato farmer</p>
<p class="body">That is the only problem you have</p>
<p class="body">You're you are the source and seat of your experiences within you</p>
<p class="body">What happens within you? </p>
<p class="body">Should it happen your way or my way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Tell me your way or my</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Way you know what happens within you</p>
<p class="body">Should it happen your way or my way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, it's within me when you say within me, do you mean my thoughts, do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Your thought, your emotion, your body, whatever your chemistry, your energy, everything, what happens within you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Mean my almost</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Should it happen your way or somebody elses way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, I think if your way sucks, maybe you should listen to other people and maybe try their way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See if it happened your way</p>
<p class="body">Would you keep yourself blissful or miserable? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You would keep yourself blissful if you're a wise</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If you are wise and your mind was working properly, but if you have mental health issues</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no no no no no no no</p>
<p class="body">That that's exactly what I'm saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If you're if</p>
<p class="body">You're filled with trauma</p>
<p class="body">If you're poorly educated, you're starting from a deficit, a severe deficit where you don't think correctly</p>
<p class="body">No they don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, that's not</p>
<p class="body">That is not that is not the problem</p>
<p class="body">The original problem, the root of the problem is this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's address one step at a time</p>
<p class="body">See right now the simple question is what happens in your mind, your emotion, your chemistry? </p>
<p class="body">Your energies must be your way, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It well is yours, yes is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is yours, so it must be your way, but it's not happening your way right now because it's in a compulsive reactive state</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So see anybody can cause anything within you</p>
<p class="body">So if I decide what clothes you must wear, what food you must eat, what you should do every day, you will call this slavery, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Or but the government</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Don't go there</p>
<p class="body">So right now someone else, something else can decide what happens within you</p>
<p class="body">Isn't this the most horrible form of slavery that someone? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's not good, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Not, that's not the best path</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So the problem is just this unintelligence which needs to be conscious is unfortunately unconscious and compulsive, so the only problem that you have is compulsive reaction to life around you</p>
<p class="body">What is needed is a conscious response to life, so this simple thing people have not handled from their childhood</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So when you don't handle this one thing, everything will be wrong</p>
<p class="body">Everything will be accidental</p>
<p class="body">We are success and failure</p>
<p class="body">Both are accidental</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So what do you say to someone? </p>
<p class="body">Maybe they're 30 years old and they've had this life of mistakes and regret and maybe alcoholism or gambling or some other problems, but they want to be conscious</p>
<p class="body">They want to be blissful</p>
<p class="body">They want to be enlightened</p>
<p class="body">They want to be a happy person, filled with love</p>
<p class="body">What path do they take? </p>
<p class="body">What what steps do they take to correct those the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Say why</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Journey they're on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Why is it, though human beings are not the strongest creatures on the planet compared to other species? </p>
<p class="body">Why is it that human beings are dominating this world? </p>
<p class="body">Simply because of our ability to use tools, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And our intellect, our ability to manipulate our environment, yes, but through innovation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no</p>
<p class="body">Yes, but even then if we didn't have knowledge of using tools right, the Buffaloes would have made us down alright, yes, so your intellect, they don't care</p>
<p class="body">It's your ability to use tools</p>
<p class="body">You made an arrow</p>
<p class="body">You made a gun</p>
<p class="body">You made so many things, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Made a house</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Everything, all instruments right now microphone or telephone or whatever else</p>
<p class="body">These are all instruments to enhance</p>
<p class="body">We are this much because of our instruments we become that much right now</p>
<p class="body">There is one little screw here in this furniture</p>
<p class="body">I will ask you, you're a strong guy</p>
<p class="body">I will ask you to unscrew this with your hands</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Can't do it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You do it</p>
<p class="body">You may lose all your nails</p>
<p class="body">I will allow you to use your teeth maybe</p>
<p class="body">You lose some of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's gonna be a problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But it'll be right there, but if I give you a screwdriver boom in a minute, you will get it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If I had a screwdriver</p>
<p class="body">I could do it easy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So this is the power of the tool</p>
<p class="body">So as there are tools for doing things in the external world, there are tools to handle this because you don't have a toolkit</p>
<p class="body">This machine, which is the most complex machine</p>
<p class="body">Is going crazy right now you're reading in engineering</p>
<p class="body">It's a toolkit, yes, you just use the tools</p>
<p class="body">Don't worry about the philosophy</p>
<p class="body">Don't worry about belief system</p>
<p class="body">Don't worry about your concept</p>
<p class="body">Somebody is concepts, your beliefs</p>
<p class="body">Somebody is beliefs</p>
<p class="body">Just use the necessary tools</p>
<p class="body">Being peaceful, joyful, loving is a natural outcome of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, well what are those tools like? </p>
<p class="body">Like the scenario that I laid out, you have a person who's 30 years old</p>
<p class="body">They they have a history of trauma in their life</p>
<p class="body">They're very unhappy, very depressed</p>
<p class="body">Maybe they're Alcoholics they're trying to get their life in order</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See see today</p>
<p class="body">Today I want you to understand this</p>
<p class="body">The user foundation and you know engineering process that we're doing around the world</p>
<p class="body">In 2021, I think 2020 or 2021. I think it's 2021</p>
<p class="body">Our video views are 2.2 billion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
2.2 billion video views</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes why? Because it's worked</p>
<p class="body">And we we have ours</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because 'cause what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It has worked</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying for people, yeah, we have over 16 million volunteers working with the foundation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">It's worked</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Why are they doing this? </p>
<p class="body">Because the only reason is it has worked</p>
<p class="body">What is it that's worked? </p>
<p class="body">I did not teach them a morality</p>
<p class="body">I did not teach them a philosophy</p>
<p class="body">I did not promise them miracles</p>
<p class="body">I did not pull gold chains out of thin air and give it to them</p>
<p class="body">No, nothing, simply tools to fix themselves</p>
<p class="body">Well, just how to sit? </p>
<p class="body">How to breathe? </p>
<p class="body">How to manage yourself this is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All, yes, you're entertaining</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, that's also one of the reasons why you have that many viewers</p>
<p class="body">How many views do we have? </p>
<p class="body">View a guest</p>
<p class="body">Please pull your mic down</p>
<p class="body">So we can hear you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">On YouTube I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Guess yeah, let's just go with you</p>
<p class="body">Tube no, no, it's OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's not the point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All told, how many views? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, I don't know, say 4 billion</p>
<p class="body">It's OK</p>
<p class="body">No, no, probably about the same sounds about right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, and we don't</p>
<p class="body">We're not teaching you **** 
<p class="body">No, that's not true</p>
<p class="body">Other people are that are on here, but I I think that I I see what you're saying that it works</p>
<p class="body">But what I'm saying is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, why it works is not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What are those tools? </p>
<p class="body">This is all very like mystical and difficult for people to grasp</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, no no. It's</p>
<p class="body">There are there are mystical aspects also, but that is not for everybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">But I mean this conversation is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That is only for those who are interested in those things who want to pursue that aspect for the rest of the people</p>
<p class="body">For somebody, if they're back back, it goes away, his life changes for somebody</p>
<p class="body">If his headache goes away, his</p>
<p class="body">Life changes, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Somebody drops his alcohol consumption addiction</p>
<p class="body">His life changes</p>
<p class="body">Yeah somebody, some compulsive thought that maybe drives him crazy</p>
<p class="body">If that goes away, these are simple things</p>
<p class="body">These are just a small screwdriver is all he needs</p>
<p class="body">He doesn't need a total</p>
<p class="body">Overhaul mysticism is a different aspect</p>
<p class="body">It is like</p>
<p class="body">You're not just interested in living well, you want to know the very root of life</p>
<p class="body">Yes, that's a different aspect</p>
<p class="body">That's not for everybody that is only for those who seek that, but for common people all they want to do is they want to live peacefully, joyfully, with some sense of purpose to whatever they are doing in their lives</p>
<p class="body">For this it's very simple</p>
<p class="body">You're talking about a case of a 30 year person and 30 year old person who has this problem this problem</p>
<p class="body">This problem, yeah, I have millions of them with me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Sure you did</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm thirty 4060 all kinds from 16 to any age. Alright, so if we did not work, they wouldn't be working for the foundation we are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We are. We are a volunteer organization with 5600 full time volunteers and over 16 million part time volunteers. Everything is done by volunteers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, obviously you're doing something right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's working, that's all I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Saying So what is it? </p>
<p class="body">When you say it is working</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, people don't know how to sit right</p>
<p class="body">People don't know how to eat, what to eat, when to eat</p>
<p class="body">They don't know</p>
<p class="body">They're just eating like instinctively</p>
<p class="body">See instinctive existence would be fine if you had the intelligence of an animal with this level of intelligence</p>
<p class="body">If you function instinctively, you will be destructive to yourself and to everybody around you</p>
<p class="body">That's what is happening in the world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Instinctively is fine if you have an animal, well, I'll listen</p>
<p class="body">I have an animal and if I left a lot of food around he would just eat himself to death</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Animals, yeah</p>
<p class="body">They won't do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That my dog would</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Say dog has become like you</p>
<p class="body">Inspired by you</p>
<p class="body">But if wild animal wild animal eat what it wants and then it'll move on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a problem, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's true, that's true</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, humans have really messed dogs up</p>
<p class="body">They've turned them into people</p>
<p class="body">Dogs are actually the the human version</p>
<p class="body">Of animals</p>
<p class="body">So when you say it works, though like for a person that is listening to this that is seeking some sort of a path to a better life, what would you recommend they do first? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">The simplest thing they need to understand is human experiences caused from within, not from outside right now, see</p>
<p class="body">Somebody can abuse you</p>
<p class="body">Let's say they're just words</p>
<p class="body">Right now I'm going to abuse you in a language that you don't understand</p>
<p class="body">India has 1300 languages I can choose, yeah</p>
<p class="body">You know India? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
1300 
<p class="body">Wow, I didn't know that wow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So I'm going to use some Indian language and abuse you with a smile on my face</p>
<p class="body">OK, you think I'm saying something very sweet to you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Go ahead</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, so my abuse is not hurting you at all</p>
<p class="body">It's only your reaction which is going to hurt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You got it right, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So in whichever language, it is, whatever nonsense it is</p>
<p class="body">It is only your reaction which hurts you</p>
<p class="body">Not my words ever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But you think my words are hurting you? </p>
<p class="body">This you must change within you</p>
<p class="body">You need to understand it's your compulsive reaction to life which hurts you, not what other people are doing</p>
<p class="body">If somebody hurts you physically, that's a different matter</p>
<p class="body">It's a survival issue</p>
<p class="body">You need to take care of that properly</p>
<p class="body">OK, physical hurt is different</p>
<p class="body">Physical pain is actually very good for you, because if there's yes I'll come</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Circle pains good for you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If there was no physical pain, most people would not know how to survive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They wouldn't know what not</p>
<p class="body">To do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, in the name of T, even though there is so much pain</p>
<p class="body">See how tattooed people are, how poked up they are all over</p>
<p class="body">If there was no pain, yeah, they've got all kinds of holes all over the place</p>
<p class="body">All right, it hurts</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying I'm not commenting on their fashion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">No no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm saying it hurts, yes, but in spite of that they're doing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I know what you're saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If there was no pain at all</p>
<p class="body">They would have pulled out their intestines and walk on the street like</p>
<p class="body">A handbag all right? </p>
<p class="body">Probably yes</p>
<p class="body">If there was no pain, people would not even know how to survive</p>
<p class="body">So in that sense, pain is good for them</p>
<p class="body">It prevents them from doing something absolutely destructive towards themselves</p>
<p class="body">So physical pain is a survival mechanism</p>
<p class="body">That's a different aspect, but rest of the pain is caused in their own mind</p>
<p class="body">Can I? </p>
<p class="body">I can cause physical pain to you, but can I cause mental pain to you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You can initiate something that might make me react</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, I will do nonsense</p>
<p class="body">Alright, I will do total nonsense, but it's you who causes that pain within yourself by reacting in a certain</p>
<p class="body">Way so if I</p>
<p class="body">Initiate things in a language that you don't understand</p>
<p class="body">You're just fine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Then it doesn't work right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Alright, so it is not my words or my actions which are causing pain to you</p>
<p class="body">It's your compulsive reaction which is causing that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This is a</p>
<p class="body">Beautiful concept but for a lot of people they develop these patterns of behavior and thinking that are very difficult to break</p>
<p class="body">So how does one come up with the practices that would allow them to consistently and continually understand this and apply this to their life? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, the patterns are formed</p>
<p class="body">Not only in the psychological structure, the patterns are formed in the chemical structure of the body</p>
<p class="body">The patterns are formed in the energy structures of the body</p>
<p class="body">The patterns are formed in the karmic structures of 1 system, so the memory patterns establish themselves in every way and make you that kind of person</p>
<p class="body">All right, but that that kind of person you are is something that you created unconsciously</p>
<p class="body">If you can create something unconsciously, you can also create the same thing consciously, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you can fix the same thing consciously, you mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I'm saying if you create one kind of persona</p>
<p class="body">Unconsciously, you can also create another kind of persona consciously isn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes you can make a conscious choice to create a healthy persona</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It, but if it's possible, yes</p>
<p class="body">So right now, because the patterns patterns are so well established is like a rut, industrial Rd all right</p>
<p class="body">If there is a deep rut in the road, even if you steer it this way, it drags you that way</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so that is what is happening in people because they have formed patterns, strong patterns, even if they once in a way think oh I must give up the drink</p>
<p class="body">They come off for two days and again they slip back into the same thing</p>
<p class="body">Because there is a chemical pattern, there is a karmic pattern</p>
<p class="body">There is a psychological pattern</p>
<p class="body">There is a compulsiveness built into the body itself</p>
<p class="body">The whole system, so that is working that way</p>
<p class="body">There are various tools and technologies as to how to break these patterns, but they must be willing to subject themselves</p>
<p class="body">You can't force them to do it</p>
<p class="body">It is not something by force</p>
<p class="body">It can only be done when somebody is willing when they have a genuine desire, then there are tools</p>
<p class="body">If you don't have the desire, even if I give you the screwdriver, you'll turn it the wrong way and tighten it further</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Saying right, I see what you're saying so</p>
<p class="body">What actions should someone take besides recognizing that the way they react to things is a conscious choice that they choose to either be upset or not, be upset, or to react to these external no? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, don't go there</p>
<p class="body">Don't go there</p>
<p class="body">Don't go there, see upset, not upset</p>
<p class="body">That is not</p>
<p class="body">The point no</p>
<p class="body">Are you a conscious response or are you an unconscious compulsive reaction? </p>
<p class="body">This is the only thing, reaction or response response means</p>
<p class="body">Right now I say something</p>
<p class="body">That you may not like</p>
<p class="body">Now you can respond the way you want, not because of what I said</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You continue to say what you want</p>
<p class="body">This is your response</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You don't have to react</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you react</p>
<p class="body">You in some way unknowingly you become enslaved to me, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what a lot of people love to do, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, they they always reacting yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's why they start fights</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They think reacting is the way</p>
<p class="body">To live, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Well, if you react, you become somebody slave, I must</p>
<p class="body">I must tell you this on a certain day I Yogi was coming this way coming to Joe Rogan show</p>
<p class="body">On the way somebody stopped him on the street and have used him in every possible way</p>
<p class="body">He listened to everything carefully</p>
<p class="body">Not ignoring them</p>
<p class="body">Listening to very alert, listening to every word of abuse</p>
<p class="body">Then he looked at the time and</p>
<p class="body">He said, see</p>
<p class="body">I have a show I need to go</p>
<p class="body">I finished that and come back</p>
<p class="body">If you have something more to say, you can tell me then</p>
<p class="body">Now these guys don't know what to do with him</p>
<p class="body">These are that kind of people</p>
<p class="body">They will say 100 things if you say one thing they will</p>
<p class="body">Next thing is they'll beat you</p>
<p class="body">But now if you say 100 things, he says he'll come back for more. You don't know what to do with him</p>
<p class="body">Why he's like this? </p>
<p class="body">He's he's decided that he is the master</p>
<p class="body">Of his destiny</p>
<p class="body">No matter who does what, he will go where he wants to go</p>
<p class="body">Intelligent man or no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">A man who goes where he wants to go no matter what anybody else is doing to him</p>
<p class="body">That is, a smart man isn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It it's definitely a better choice than just being a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Reactionary if your reaction you will go away their way</p>
<p class="body">Yes, somebody will take you their way</p>
<p class="body">Somebody will take you this way</p>
<p class="body">Somebody will take you that way</p>
<p class="body">Such a person</p>
<p class="body">Will they ever achieve anything that they wish</p>
<p class="body">To in their life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They might get lucky</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See those those who achieve things by luck</p>
<p class="body">Always live with the fear of losing</p>
<p class="body">It yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They panic, right? </p>
<p class="body">And they're always worried and they they get greedy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Because they're scared</p>
<p class="body">This came by chance and it may go away by chance</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They have famine mentality</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, if if you have, if you've done it by knowing what you're doing</p>
<p class="body">If you lose everything today, you can create it again because you know the mechanics of how to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do right and likely you won't lose it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You won't lose it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah so</p>
<p class="body">What should a person do? </p>
<p class="body">Should they start taking yoga? </p>
<p class="body">Should they start thinking a certain way every day about their life and the way they're responding to things, and whether or not they're reacting or being conscious? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Is that guy falling off the sky or is he doing yoga in your studio? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He's getting abducted by a UFO</p>
<p class="body">That's, uh, that's a flying saucer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I get</p>
<p class="body">I do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You what do you think about flying saucers? </p>
<p class="body">What do you think about like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I will come, let's do yoga first</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">We'll get to that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We'll get to that OK</p>
<p class="body">So right now we're trying to fix the soil to another place</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Now I'm excited</p>
<p class="body">Project let's go with yoga first</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So the word yoga</p>
<p class="body">In United States it scares me</p>
<p class="body">Micos here yoga means you must look like a leftover noodle twisted out like this like that right? </p>
<p class="body">The word yoga means union</p>
<p class="body">Union Union means right now we were talking about the soil as you sit here, you are just</p>
<p class="body">An outcrop of soil you may not realize this because you're sitting on a chair</p>
<p class="body">You're wearing shoes, and because you can prance around</p>
<p class="body">But if you were made like a tree, you would clearly understand you are part of</p>
<p class="body">The soil isn't it, yes? </p>
<p class="body">Or most people will understand when you bury them</p>
<p class="body">Then they know they're part of the soil</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise, they just don't know that they're part of the soil they think they came from somewhere</p>
<p class="body">A lot of people started talking, I'm</p>
<p class="body">From some other planet, this talk is also going on, but essentially</p>
<p class="body">You are part of this, but you are not experiencing it that way</p>
<p class="body">This is not only true with soil, this is true with the entire creation</p>
<p class="body">With the cosmos itself</p>
<p class="body">Today, modern science has come to this that as you sit here, every subatomic particle in your body is actually in communication with everything else</p>
<p class="body">Is this an image of Cosmos that you have? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Sort of just random stars, and occasionally you'll see a shooting star</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So it is this is a</p>
<p class="body">Part of everything, yes</p>
<p class="body">If you don't go want to go that far, at least this is a part of the planet</p>
<p class="body">There is no question about that</p>
<p class="body">That's very clear</p>
<p class="body">But such an experience is not there</p>
<p class="body">If can I tell you my how this happened to me, yes</p>
<p class="body">So when I was four or five years of age</p>
<p class="body">I suddenly realized I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">I don't know anything means I don't know anything at all</p>
<p class="body">I look at a glass of water</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what this is</p>
<p class="body">I know I can drink it</p>
<p class="body">I know in how many ways I can use it, but I don't</p>
<p class="body">Know what it is</p>
<p class="body">Even today, with so much scientific exploration, we still do not know one atom in its entirety</p>
<p class="body">We know how to use it</p>
<p class="body">We know how to break it, we know how to fuse it, we know how to make a bomb out of</p>
<p class="body">It, but we don't know what it is</p>
<p class="body">Even today we don't know what</p>
<p class="body">It is</p>
<p class="body">So if I found a leaf, I'm just staring at it for 5-6 hours at a stretch. If I sit up in the bed, I'm just staring at the darkness for the whole night</p>
<p class="body">My dear father, being a physician started thinking I need some psychiatric evaluation</p>
<p class="body">He started saying this boy is staring at something all the time</p>
<p class="body">It looks like he's lost it</p>
<p class="body">My problem is I'm looking at this</p>
<p class="body">I still don't know what this is</p>
<p class="body">I'm not able to shift my attention to anything else</p>
<p class="body">In this condition they send me to school</p>
<p class="body">My mother said don't look here in there</p>
<p class="body">Pay attention to the teacher</p>
<p class="body">So I went and paid attention to the teacher, the kind of attention they would have never received in their entire life</p>
<p class="body">I'm paying absolute attention to the teacher</p>
<p class="body">Initially, I kind of understood what they were trying to say, but after some time I realized</p>
<p class="body">That they're just making noises</p>
<p class="body">I'm making up the meanings in my mind even now</p>
<p class="body">It is so, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Language is a conspiracy between two people</p>
<p class="body">The moment I talk another language you, I'm just making sounds as far as you're concerned</p>
<p class="body">So when I just heard they're just making sounds, I'm the one who's making up the meanings</p>
<p class="body">I stopped making meanings hour after about teacher after teacher</p>
<p class="body">They come and make noises and noises and noises and go</p>
<p class="body">It became so amusing to me a big smile spread on my face</p>
<p class="body">They were not amused at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you were five when this? </p>
<p class="body">Was happening, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They sent me to school when I was three and a half</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did this accelerate over time? </p>
<p class="body">Did it start off slowly and come? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, the The thing is I don't know one thing from the other</p>
<p class="body">I look at the sky</p>
<p class="body">Tremendous things</p>
<p class="body">I look at it tree</p>
<p class="body">I see every leaf and it drives me crazy</p>
<p class="body">I can't figure out where this coming from what's happening, endless amount of things</p>
<p class="body">If I look at a Pebble, I'll keep on looking at it for hours because I don't know what</p>
<p class="body">It is because there is so much to it</p>
<p class="body">If you take an atom, you can spend a lifetime looking at it, still not knowing what it is</p>
<p class="body">That's the nature of the creation</p>
<p class="body">All right? </p>
<p class="body">It's that complex</p>
<p class="body">So my schooling went on like this and</p>
<p class="body">I slowly started going there only when it was absolutely necessary, otherwise I had my own excursions going</p>
<p class="body">So about 11-12 years ago this school where I studied over 50 years ago, they come to me and say, sadhguru, you must come. It is our 125th anniversary of the school. You must come and speak</p>
<p class="body">I said, see</p>
<p class="body">Why me? </p>
<p class="body">Because I was not just a not good student</p>
<p class="body">I was not even a student</p>
<p class="body">I was barely there, why? </p>
<p class="body">Why are you asking me to come? </p>
<p class="body">I'm not a good example for any of your students</p>
<p class="body">They said no</p>
<p class="body">Our school has produced ministers</p>
<p class="body">Our school has produced cricketing stars, sports stars, film stars</p>
<p class="body">You are the only Mystic so you must come</p>
<p class="body">It's so I went</p>
<p class="body">I went and stood up to speak in the same quadrangle, the oppressive buildings around me</p>
<p class="body">And I looked at this classroom and I suddenly remembered and I narrated this to them</p>
<p class="body">See, I was around 12 years of age</p>
<p class="body">And one teacher came, and those days, because I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">What's there to talk for days on end? </p>
<p class="body">I don't utter a word, I just go to the sports field</p>
<p class="body">I play intensely any game that is there and classroom home</p>
<p class="body">I don't say a thing because I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">So what is there to say? </p>
<p class="body">So this teacher is asking me some question</p>
<p class="body">I'm looking at him</p>
<p class="body">I know his past, present and future sitting there, but I don't know what he's talking about</p>
<p class="body">Initially I hear the words after some time I'm just seeing him like a blob of energy like that, and I know that guy through and through, but I don't know what he's talking about, 3540 minutes. He tried to get an answer from me</p>
<p class="body">I didn't say nothing</p>
<p class="body">So he came help me with the shoulder shook me violently like this and said you must be either the divine or the devil</p>
<p class="body">I think you're the latter</p>
<p class="body">So till then my problem was I didn't know what is this</p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">But it was clear this was me</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly this guy confused me about this</p>
<p class="body">Also, I looked at myself</p>
<p class="body">What is this? </p>
<p class="body">Is this divine devil? </p>
<p class="body">What the hell is this? </p>
<p class="body">This question had never come to me till I was twelve</p>
<p class="body">I had a question about everything in the universe</p>
<p class="body">But this was clear</p>
<p class="body">This was me</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly this guy confused me about this also</p>
<p class="body">Then I tried to stare at myself</p>
<p class="body">It didn't work</p>
<p class="body">I started closing my eyes</p>
<p class="body">And initially it started with minutes</p>
<p class="body">It went into hours</p>
<p class="body">It went into days</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes I just close my eyes and sat for days</p>
<p class="body">On end</p>
<p class="body">This changed the whole experience of my life when I was 25. I just burst into an experience where</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly every cell in my body was dripping ecstasy like that</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly, yeah, I was sitting on a rock and just I burst out like this for the first time in my life</p>
<p class="body">Adult life tears were coming</p>
<p class="body">Tears and me were impossible</p>
<p class="body">I lived like that</p>
<p class="body">So I was just wondering what's happening when I I thought it's 1015 minutes when I came out it was 4 1/2 hours. My shirt was wet with tears</p>
<p class="body">That what's happening to me</p>
<p class="body">Am I going off the rocker or something? </p>
<p class="body">That's the only thing my skeptical mind could tell me because I was a super skeptic about everything in the universe</p>
<p class="body">I had a question about everything about the family structure about the social society, about religion, about politics, about economics, about everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So what do you think was happening? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll tell you then</p>
<p class="body">I talked to my closest friends</p>
<p class="body">Hey, something is happening to me, I'm just</p>
<p class="body">Blissed out, you know if I just talk to them tears are coming to me</p>
<p class="body">I said what's happening to you, man</p>
<p class="body">You, what did you drink? </p>
<p class="body">What did you pop? </p>
<p class="body">This is a question then I knew there was no context to my experience, so I spent started spending more and more time by myself</p>
<p class="body">And I realized if I just take my hands off my mind completely</p>
<p class="body">Then I see that every cell in my body just bursts out with blissfulness</p>
<p class="body">Then I established this properly within myself</p>
<p class="body">How to do that? </p>
<p class="body">Then I sat down and made a plan</p>
<p class="body">At that time, the world's population was 5.6 billion people. I made a plan in 2 1/2 years time. I will make the whole world ecstatic here. I am 40 years later</p>
<p class="body">It took me time to realize people are so deeply invested in their miseries that even if you offer them the best thing, they will go round and round and round around that not getting the point because they're too deeply invested in something they don't realize as you sit here</p>
<p class="body">And through your misery or joy, life is slipping away</p>
<p class="body">Every heartbeat is life going away, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's not the clock ticking</p>
<p class="body">It is life ticking away as we sit here moment by moment we're getting closer to our grave people don't understand they're mortal</p>
<p class="body">This is the biggest problem on a daily basis</p>
<p class="body">They're not conscious that as I sit here, my time is running out</p>
<p class="body">I need to make the best</p>
<p class="body">Out of this</p>
<p class="body">If I'm conscious that I'm mortal if I know my time is running out, I would keep myself in the best possible way</p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't have time to quarrel with somebody I wouldn't have time to do nasty things to somebody or to myself</p>
<p class="body">I would do the best to myself unnaturally when you're feeling wonderful</p>
<p class="body">You do wonderful things to everybody around you, a happy person or very joyful person is naturally a pleasant person to everybody</p>
<p class="body">When you're feeling nasty, you will share it with people</p>
<p class="body">Of course the same nastiness</p>
<p class="body">So this process I decided we must somehow share this with people</p>
<p class="body">So I started building devices</p>
<p class="body">I was practicing yoga since I was 12 years of age</p>
<p class="body">A simple form of yoga that also I got in for all the wrong reasons</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All the wrong reasons</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, in the sense I was around 11-12 years of age this was my</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The story about the well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know the story, so I got in for the wrong reason, thinking I'll become a superhuman like him</p>
<p class="body">But it is something else to me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The story to people so they hear it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know this is a ancestral home where we are about 3536 of Cousin Brothers and sisters who live in different cities</p>
<p class="body">We all come and converge in our ancestral home for the summer vacation, usually 30 to 45 days Max</p>
<p class="body">So it's 1 rollicking place</p>
<p class="body">All the kids totally out of control and doing all kinds of things</p>
<p class="body">The young boys</p>
<p class="body">One of the things is there's a drinking water well in the backyard, which is about 8-8 feet in diameter, about 150 feet in depth</p>
<p class="body">In summer months, when we go there, it's at least 6070 feet below the ground level. The water</p>
<p class="body">So we jump into this</p>
<p class="body">Well you have to go straight</p>
<p class="body">If you go this way your brain will become a smear on the wall actually</p>
<p class="body">You have to go straight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did that ever happen? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's happened to other people, not to me</p>
<p class="body">My brains are still here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You people who died</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Know no, not in our house</p>
<p class="body">It didn't happen</p>
<p class="body">It's happened to other boys, yeah</p>
<p class="body">And when you want to come up, there is no step or anything</p>
<p class="body">You just have to hold the</p>
<p class="body">Rock and come up</p>
<p class="body">You know you're just about 1 centimeter</p>
<p class="body">Half an inch is what you have in the rock</p>
<p class="body">Your entire weight is on these four fingers, so your nails will start bleeding out of sheer pressure so I could come up pretty well</p>
<p class="body">I was</p>
<p class="body">Coming up very well on out of that, so I'm very proud and I can do it better than people</p>
<p class="body">So one day we are doing this act and a man who is over 70 years of age was watching us without a word</p>
<p class="body">He just walked and jumped into the well</p>
<p class="body">I thought the old guys finished</p>
<p class="body">But he came up faster than me</p>
<p class="body">I didn't like it</p>
<p class="body">I said how? </p>
<p class="body">He said, come into yoga so I followed him like a puppy so I got into yoga for all the wrong reasons</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying this because even for wrong reasons, if you do the right things right, things will happen to you</p>
<p class="body">This is a beauty about this world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this was how old we at the</p>
<p class="body">Time to have</p>
<p class="body">So this was along the same time that you were having these realizations about the nature of things</p>
<p class="body">It was they all sort of came together like it's a very fortuitous sort of convergence</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When I look back and I look back, it's all like a set plan all right</p>
<p class="body">At that time it was all wonderful accidents happening, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a thing that happens though sometimes right when you're on the right path, like wonderful accidents do sort of seem to happen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See The thing is just this</p>
<p class="body">If you're designed to fly</p>
<p class="body">If something is designed to fly</p>
<p class="body">If the stronger the wind is, the higher it flies you know</p>
<p class="body">I'm a licensed helicopter pilot</p>
<p class="body">Oh really</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, everybody thinks winds are a bad thing</p>
<p class="body">No winds are great only when you're landing</p>
<p class="body">If it's cross wind, it's a little bit of a issue otherwise</p>
<p class="body">Without headwind you can't really fly</p>
<p class="body">Alright too much</p>
<p class="body">A storm is a different thing, but headwinds are good</p>
<p class="body">That's why the airplane flies alright</p>
<p class="body">It's because of that there is aerodynamics and it flies</p>
<p class="body">So if your design to fly this is what is important</p>
<p class="body">What yoga means is you get yourself geometrically correct</p>
<p class="body">What being genetically correct means is see every physical creation in the universe has a geometry to it</p>
<p class="body">If the geometry is in such a way that it has least amount of friction</p>
<p class="body">Then it functions at its best</p>
<p class="body">When would you say? </p>
<p class="body">Suppose you start your car engine and he said cut, cut, cut, cut, cut</p>
<p class="body">Would you say this is well engineered car? </p>
<p class="body">You start it, you don't even know you can't feel the engine</p>
<p class="body">Then you said this is a good car because it's only unless you make it roar</p>
<p class="body">You can't feel the engine</p>
<p class="body">That means everything is going smoothly with least amount of friction, so it is a geometric perfection which does this</p>
<p class="body">So everything that is physical in the universe needs</p>
<p class="body">A certain perfection of geometry to function at a certain level of competence</p>
<p class="body">So this geometry</p>
<p class="body">Today there is something called as constructional theory</p>
<p class="body">They're making it yogic sciences are deeply invested in this</p>
<p class="body">That is how an atom is made, how an amoeba is made, a single celled Organism is made</p>
<p class="body">How you are made, how the universe is made</p>
<p class="body">The fundamental design is not different</p>
<p class="body">It's the same design</p>
<p class="body">The complexity and sophistication is multiplying many, many fold, but essentially it's the same design</p>
<p class="body">So this is what today we're calling as the carbon chain on this planet</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's a microorganism or a tree or the atmosphere or the water or a human being, everything is 1 chain</p>
<p class="body">If you break one link, everything could collapse on your head</p>
<p class="body">You know that's what we're talking about when we talk about soil</p>
<p class="body">One link has become very weak if we don't strengthen that</p>
<p class="body">The entire chain could collapse</p>
<p class="body">Because a chain is as strong as a individual link, and this one link of the soil has become super thin, if you push it any further the whole thing, the very chain of life could collapse</p>
<p class="body">So it is the geometry which keeps it going</p>
<p class="body">For example, this planet is going around the sun</p>
<p class="body">There is no titanium, titanium chain or a cable holding it to the sun and</p>
<p class="body">Swinging it around, it's just a perfection of geometry</p>
<p class="body">If you just get it off its path finished, it'll fly off somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">It'll burn itself out only because of certain geometries</p>
<p class="body">Hit a certain geometry, they're all</p>
<p class="body">There look like perpetual machines</p>
<p class="body">They're not perpetual</p>
<p class="body">In our experience, they're perpetual because our life span is so small, but otherwise it's not perpetual</p>
<p class="body">At one time it was not there at some time</p>
<p class="body">In future, if it will not be there again, that's a different matter, but right now it is hit a certain geometric perfection that it keeps going as if it's forever</p>
<p class="body">So yoga 1 aspect of yoga</p>
<p class="body">Is this</p>
<p class="body">To get your body to a geometrically congruent state with the rest of the creation</p>
<p class="body">If you are geometrically congruent, suddenly your experience is not that of an individual, but that of being universal</p>
<p class="body">So to put it very, very simply it's like this</p>
<p class="body">See, we can do an experiment, can we? </p>
<p class="body">Just put your hands together with your eyes closed</p>
<p class="body">What you do is you rub your hands very briskly for 30 seconds</p>
<p class="body">Now hold it three or four</p>
<p class="body">Inches away from each other</p>
<p class="body">Something happening between them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Don't you feel something? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I feel the heat of each hand</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Not the heat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is it warm from friction? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Now, isn't there a sensation between them? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<p class="body">So right now see right now what is the difference between you and the chair on which you're sitting? </p>
<p class="body">It's only the sensations which tells you how do you know this is me? </p>
<p class="body">This is not me right here</p>
<p class="body">There are sensations here, no sensations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So essentially what you call as myself is a certain boundary of sensations</p>
<p class="body">It's essentially boundary which determines what is you and what is not</p>
<p class="body">You isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, this water, is it you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Will become me when I drink it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you put it into the boundaries of your sensation, it becomes you</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and that's how this whole thing has come right when you were born</p>
<p class="body">You were this much now you become this much. It's the food that you've eaten water that you took and everything into the boundaries of your sensation. Now you experience it as myself, 100%. So if you lose 10 kilograms</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Would you think that 10 kilograms of me is gone? </p>
<p class="body">No, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, what if you look in the mirror? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no in your experience</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Your experience is exactly the same except</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Exactly the same because what is in within the boundaries of your sensation is you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Maybe you feel healthier</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you do anything vigorous or intense, suddenly the boundaries of your sensation is breached and you experience something more</p>
<p class="body">Why there is such a big draw? </p>
<p class="body">Towards sexuality or people are rubbing each other all the time</p>
<p class="body">Is just this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Rubbing each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know way</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying it is because somewhere for one moment they are something more than what they are, somebody or something which is not themselves becomes a part of them, at least for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">A moment yes</p>
<p class="body">This breaching of sensory boundary is yoga</p>
<p class="body">If you sit here and if you can spread your sensory body as big as this room, you would experience everything in this room as yourself</p>
<p class="body">See right now your heart, your liver, your kidney, the five fingers of your hand</p>
<p class="body">This was not you some time ago, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">You and you are a baby</p>
<p class="body">Your finger was this much now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It became this much</p>
<p class="body">That means these fingers, the way they are</p>
<p class="body">They were not you just some time ago, but today they 100% you isn't it? How did this happen? Because this material got accumulated within the sense boundaries of your sensory body sensory body</p>
<p class="body">If you make yourself exuberant, either because of joy or blissfulness, sensory body expands</p>
<p class="body">If you expand your body in such a way, it's as big as the universe</p>
<p class="body">You will experience the whole universe as yourself</p>
<p class="body">This is yoga</p>
<p class="body">So the twisting turning holding the breath, doing this, doing that all these things are to loosen up the body in such a way that your physical body and your sensory body are</p>
<p class="body">Not stuck to each other, sensory body can expand today, you know if somebody lost a limb or something</p>
<p class="body">They have something called as a phantom leg</p>
<p class="body">Even if the leg is gone, they're still experiencing the leg because the sensory body is still not there</p>
<p class="body">So essentially physical body is acting like a scaffolding for the sensory body, which gives the experience of life</p>
<p class="body">If your sensory body was totally dead, you wouldn't experience anything, even if you had your body alright</p>
<p class="body">So if your sensory body expands, you'll experience this whole room or this building, or this town as yourself</p>
<p class="body">So this is what yoga means</p>
<p class="body">This is the purpose of yoga because once you experience somebody or something as a part of yourself</p>
<p class="body">Nobody has to teach you any morality</p>
<p class="body">Be good, don't harm them</p>
<p class="body">Don't do this</p>
<p class="body">Don't do that</p>
<p class="body">These teachings will be irrelevant for you, because anything that nobody ever taught you</p>
<p class="body">This little finger don't bite it off</p>
<p class="body">It is a poor little finger</p>
<p class="body">Nobody had to tell you this because it's you write what you experience as myself</p>
<p class="body">With that you have no conflict</p>
<p class="body">This is what yoga means. The mechanism of getting there. There are various mechanisms. There are actually 112</p>
<p class="body">Proper technologies as to how one can get into that space</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
112 You talked about in your book that I was reading. You talked about the the different kinds of yoga and you told a very funny story about God getting them all together</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">The four yogis? Yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Dude, you mind telling that what? </p>
<p class="body">What are the different types of yoga there's? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Say you can do employ your body and perform action and do yoga</p>
<p class="body">This is karma yoga</p>
<p class="body">Karma means action using action to attain unity</p>
<p class="body">With the existence</p>
<p class="body">If you use your intelligence to get attain unity with the existence, then it is called as Nana Yoga, yoga, intelligence</p>
<p class="body">If you use your emotion to get there, that is called as bhakti yoga</p>
<p class="body">Yoga of devotion or emotion</p>
<p class="body">And if you use your energies by refining and expanding your energies, if you do it, that is called as Kriya yoga</p>
<p class="body">The Science and technology of expanding one's energies. So these are the only four ways you can do because these are only four things you have</p>
<p class="body">Rest is all imagination</p>
<p class="body">We have a body, you have a mind</p>
<p class="body">You have emotions and you have energies</p>
<p class="body">Life energies within you</p>
<p class="body">Beyond this rest is all made up in terms of your beliefs and imaginations</p>
<p class="body">These are the four realities you can only work with what you have</p>
<p class="body">You cannot work with what you don't have, so these four things</p>
<p class="body">Is there anybody who is only body, no mind, no emotion, no energy or only mind, not the other three? </p>
<p class="body">All of us are a combination of the</p>
<p class="body">Four, it's just</p>
<p class="body">That in one person, the body may be dominant in another person</p>
<p class="body">The mind may be dominant in another person</p>
<p class="body">Emotion like this, different combinations of the same four ingredients are there in different human beings and different persons</p>
<p class="body">So accordingly, yoga has to be mixed</p>
<p class="body">This is why the significance in the Eastern cultures of having</p>
<p class="body">A live guru? </p>
<p class="body">Who's looking at you and making the right concoction? </p>
<p class="body">Let's say you came to me when you were 20</p>
<p class="body">Naturally, your body would be very dominant</p>
<p class="body">We would give you one type of yoga</p>
<p class="body">Now you returned when you're 40</p>
<p class="body">Now maybe your mind is more dominant</p>
<p class="body">Maybe your emotion is more dominant</p>
<p class="body">Maybe energy is more dominant</p>
<p class="body">Body could have receded a little</p>
<p class="body">Bit so accordingly it has to be mixed so it is not like a common prescription</p>
<p class="body">Everybody do this, everybody do</p>
<p class="body">This is not going to work</p>
<p class="body">It needs to be mixed the right way</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise, it won't work</p>
<p class="body">This is one reason a whole lot of people on the spiritual path feel first three months</p>
<p class="body">They seem to be going somewhere after that they are stagnant because nobody to gauge that and you know tweak that thing according to their needs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So they need a guru</p>
<p class="body">They need someone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">To see the word guru is a</p>
4 letter word today in America</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, because they are fake ones, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's why that's why I'm a Satguru. It has 88 alphabets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Will you tell the story about God getting all the girls together? </p>
<p class="body">All the different types of yogis together? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So this is, uh, on a certain day, 4 yogis are walking in the forest</p>
<p class="body">One is a Gnana Yogi yoga of intelligence</p>
<p class="body">Another is a karma Yogi body yoga</p>
<p class="body">Another is Bhakti Yogi emotional and devotional Yogi and other is a Kriya Yogi, master of energies</p>
<p class="body">So suddenly a stomp picks up and they start running to find a shelter</p>
<p class="body">The Bhakti Yogi who has I don't know who knows the geography of temples in the area</p>
<p class="body">He says</p>
<p class="body">Let's go in this direction</p>
<p class="body">There's an ancient temple there, so they all ran there</p>
<p class="body">Then they found an ancient temple where the walls had collapsed long time ago</p>
<p class="body">Just the roof and in the center there's a</p>
<p class="body">Day T they</p>
<p class="body">All rushed into the temple, not out of love for the day T or God</p>
<p class="body">There was no other place to sit, so they all four of them hugged the deity and sat down</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly God appeared</p>
<p class="body">They all wondered why</p>
<p class="body">Now we did so much yoga you didn't come now when we're just escaping the storm, you turn up so they looked at him</p>
<p class="body">Why now? </p>
<p class="body">So God said at last you 4 idiots got together</p>
<p class="body">I've been waiting for this for a long time</p>
<p class="body">Body going One Direction, mind going another direction and emotion another way</p>
<p class="body">How will anything happen? </p>
<p class="body">These four things have to come together</p>
<p class="body">This is very important, but today the way it is happening, the yoga</p>
<p class="body">It's become very more</p>
<p class="body">More like a exercise</p>
<p class="body">If you want exercise, there are so many ways to do it goes</p>
<p class="body">Have a swim</p>
<p class="body">Maybe play tennis, maybe climb a mountain</p>
<p class="body">You'll get much better exercise</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is not for exercise</p>
<p class="body">It will also give you that</p>
<p class="body">It'll give you fitness. Also there are different types of yoga's for fitness. There are certain kind of yoga you must come. We can do this with you. It's called anger mordonna that means mastering your limbs</p>
<p class="body">Without any equipment, you can master your limbs in such a way that you become very resilient. People are asking me, sadhguru, you're 65 years of age</p>
<p class="body">How will you do this 30,000 kilometers on a lone motorcycle yourself riding like this across 26 or 27 countries? </p>
<p class="body">I was just joking with them and I said see this is an advertisement for a yogic back</p>
<p class="body">You will say I will ride</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How did yoga get started? </p>
<p class="body">Like what what do you think was the origin of it? </p>
<p class="body">Because it's an ancient form of</p>
<p class="body">However, you want to call it an ancient practice, like what and it's obviously very beneficial to so many people to practice it</p>
<p class="body">How did it get started? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, there is nothing in the universe which is not yoga</p>
<p class="body">In the sense</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing in the universe which is not one with everything else</p>
<p class="body">Except human mind</p>
<p class="body">This is what we're talking about, soil also</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing on this planet which is unconnected</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing in this solar system unconnected</p>
<p class="body">There's nothing in this universe unconnected, so everything is in yoga</p>
<p class="body">The question is only whether you realize that or not</p>
<p class="body">If you realize that if you experience that, then we call you a Yogi</p>
<p class="body">Yogi means not somebody who is twisting and turning</p>
<p class="body">Yogi means one who is experiencing the Union right now</p>
<p class="body">That though you're an individual, your experience has gone beyond your individual nature you're experiencing</p>
<p class="body">The universality of your existence</p>
<p class="body">Your individual nature is a psychological condition</p>
<p class="body">See physically, this is what we've been talking about</p>
<p class="body">Soil nourishment, everything physically</p>
<p class="body">If people don't understand this, if you close these two holes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In those holes, yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Keep your mouth also close</p>
close this and see if you're not connected with the oxygen bubble around you</p>
<p class="body">You won't exist for two minutes, right? </p>
<p class="body">So where is your individuality? </p>
<p class="body">I'm saying physically</p>
<p class="body">With food, water with everything else, we can say it in so many different ways, but physically you know there is no individuality to your body</p>
<p class="body">Only psychologically, this individual nature we have taken it too seriously simply because it's the magnanimity of creation</p>
<p class="body">That which has given us an individual experience actually</p>
<p class="body">In this cosmos, we are like a speck</p>
<p class="body">If you, if you look at the solar system itself from somewhere</p>
<p class="body">A million light years away, the solar system itself is a tiny spec in that planet</p>
<p class="body">Earth is a micro spec in that micro spec</p>
<p class="body">Texas is a Super Micro spec in that Austin is a super Super Micro spec in that you are a big man</p>
<p class="body">This is a serious problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">You take yourself seriously when you're really connected to everything and you think of yourself as an individual when you're not</p>
<p class="body">You're really a part of everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Your individuality is just a psychological thing, you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Want to see a funny meme that points to that? </p>
<p class="body">I bought that Sam Tripoli meme</p>
<p class="body">Do you, yeah, do you know what? </p>
<p class="body">Memes are, I think so yeah</p>
<p class="body">They're funny things that people, well, it's</p>
<p class="body">It's like a kind of a new form of comedy, but this one relates very closely to what you're saying, and it's this right here</p>
<p class="body">You are here</p>
<p class="body">Crying in the shower before work</p>
<p class="body">Pointing to</p>
<p class="body">The outer regions of the Milky Way Galaxy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, so this tiny micro micro Super Micro spec thinks it's the center of the universe, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Funny, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is serious issue</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a big problem for a lot of people, and you know what's the function of that</p>
<p class="body">So like, why does the human animal think that way, like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See as I said this is the magnanimity of creation</p>
<p class="body">Though you're a tiny speck, you have an individual experience</p>
<p class="body">This is the greatest gift that we have</p>
<p class="body">We can sit here, even wonder about the universe not knowing where it begins, where it ends all right</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so this is a tremendous gift that we have been given an individuality</p>
<p class="body">But you're taking it too seriously for this</p>
<p class="body">The only cure is that you're always conscious that you're mortal</p>
<p class="body">Your time you're on a limited lease of time</p>
<p class="body">If you know this, you will not take your individuality seriously</p>
<p class="body">You will enjoy it</p>
<p class="body">The way it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The problem is our culture</p>
<p class="body">Thrives on individuals taking themselves seriously</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is why</p>
<p class="body">There is the most affluent country on the planet</p>
<p class="body">Look at the amount of miseries people are going through</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's a lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, I remember this</p>
<p class="body">Uh, I was in 98 for the first time when I came to United States</p>
<p class="body">I went there to the US embassy in Chennai to get my visa</p>
<p class="body">So this is you had to at that time you had to go at like 6:30 in the morning</p>
<p class="body">It would start at that time, 7:00 o'clock they will start seeing you</p>
<p class="body">I went there because, you know, the consul general</p>
<p class="body">A fine lady</p>
<p class="body">She had heard about me</p>
<p class="body">So instead of just doing at the counter, she asked me to come to her office</p>
<p class="body">So I went there and there she asked me see, you're going to United States? </p>
<p class="body">We've heard so much about you in India, but you know if you want to teach in the United</p>
<p class="body">States you need</p>
<p class="body">A A teacher</p>
<p class="body">You know yoga teacher certificate</p>
<p class="body">Are you certified? </p>
<p class="body">I said if I had asked for a certification from my guru, you would have cut my throat so I don't have</p>
<p class="body">I live yoga, I don't I don't. I'm not certified. Then we had a long chat and then I was coming out by about maybe 7:45</p>
<p class="body">Then I see outside the US embassy at the outside the compound one young man, young boy like maybe in his early 20s sitting and crying</p>
<p class="body">Literally crying his heart out</p>
<p class="body">I couldn't ignore him</p>
<p class="body">You know my car was already there and</p>
<p class="body">Then I got off the car and went to him and asked, hey what's the problem? </p>
<p class="body">His visa got rejected</p>
<p class="body">The guy so bitter he could kill himself</p>
<p class="body">He's in that kind of condition</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, they didn't</p>
<p class="body">Let you go</p>
<p class="body">So word about it</p>
<p class="body">But that's not how it is</p>
<p class="body">People think going to United States is everything</p>
<p class="body">Ask the people who are living here how</p>
<p class="body">Many complaints they have</p>
<p class="body">They are miserable because they are here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You're not crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what I'm saying, because human misery is not in India or America</p>
<p class="body">It is within you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">One of the things that struck me from your book was that you didn't read a lot of the writings on yoga until you're much older</p>
<p class="body">You were practicing yoga, but you hadn't read</p>
<p class="body">Read any of the ancient texts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I have never read any ancient texts</p>
<p class="body">Not even now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Really, yes, you don't have any desire to find what they were thinking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because my own clarity has never failed me, I don't want to confuse myself because</p>
<p class="body">We don't know in these many thousands of years who all have added whatever nonsense they've added to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You never know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a problem like human beings</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Over period of time you know every scripture has been meddled with by people, but anyway</p>
<p class="body">All scriptures, it doesn't matter where they got the information from, how they received it, but written by human beings or write languages written by human beings</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">All right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's no question</p>
<p class="body">People may say God dictated to me, but still even if I dictate something to you, you can still write it wrong</p>
<p class="body">So I'm saying</p>
<p class="body">Those books I never read</p>
<p class="body">The only book I read is this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Body your soul, your experience you yeah whatever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This this</p>
<p class="body">This this mechanism, which is in my</p>
<p class="body">In my experience, because nothing else is in your experience, just see this</p>
<p class="body">You can't experience what's here</p>
<p class="body">You can only experience what is here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you find that? </p>
<p class="body">That's kind of contradictory in some ways to your existence, because your what you're doing is expressing your experience to other people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, no</p>
<p class="body">I'm not expressing no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You're not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I see some experience</p>
<p class="body">What did that Joe Rogan experience? </p>
<p class="body">Oh OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's the name of the podcast</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So I'm never, you know here and there when people ask questions</p>
<p class="body">I may say something, but as I said, there's no philosophy</p>
<p class="body">There is no teaching</p>
<p class="body">There's no belief system, just methods</p>
<p class="body">Yes, but you sit like this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You've given so much wisdom, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You breathe like this</p>
<p class="body">You do this this and this</p>
<p class="body">This will happen to you</p>
<p class="body">Your experiment</p>
40 days you do it</p>
<p class="body">If it works, you keep it</p>
<p class="body">If it doesn't work</p>
<p class="body">Try it and move</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">On, but do you see that you've written all this down for people to learn from? </p>
<p class="body">No, you haven't</p>
<p class="body">Why did you write it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I have not written down anything what is in the book what is in the book is more like a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You have books</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Brochure a brochure</p>
<p class="body">It's a you know 300 page brochure. Just introducing you, that's not we will never write down what you have to use that has to be transmitted</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, but you are riding your own personal experiences and people benefit from that greatly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That is more for inspiration</p>
<p class="body">A book is for inspiration, not for instruction</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">And you don't think that there's any inspiration to be gleamed from other people's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Experiences. It is, of course</p>
<p class="body">In Spitze, if you're looking for inspiration, is one thing</p>
<p class="body">If you're looking for instruction, don't look in the book</p>
<p class="body">No, no inspiration is different to get you fired up</p>
<p class="body">Once you're fired up, you want to know now</p>
<p class="body">Don't go on reading books that will not get you anywhere</p>
<p class="body">You have to to start delve deeper into yourself</p>
<p class="body">For that we can give you methods how to go deeper</p>
<p class="body">See when I like we were talking</p>
<p class="body">About the screwdriver, yes</p>
<p class="body">How to do the? </p>
<p class="body">Thing you know with the right kind of tool</p>
<p class="body">If you use the wrong kind of tool, I give you a spanner for the screw which is in the furniture</p>
<p class="body">It's not going to help</p>
<p class="body">It's a tool, but it's not going to help the right tool, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's all that is</p>
<p class="body">All my work is to give them the right tool</p>
<p class="body">I will not use the tool for them, they must use it only for a few who completely give themselves for them</p>
<p class="body">I may also turn the screws for them, but largely we just give you the screwdriver</p>
<p class="body">It's up to you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But even when you were younger, you didn't seek inspiration from some other peoples experiences</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Somehow it didn't work like that for me for me</p>
<p class="body">Everything was a question mark</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying if I see a leaf, it's a question</p>
<p class="body">If I see a look at my father, it's a question</p>
<p class="body">If I look at my mother, it's a question they were wonderful loving parents, but I had questions about everything, nothing</p>
<p class="body">Negative, just a question, because question is a tool to dig deeper</p>
<p class="body">Question is a not a way of insulting somebody</p>
<p class="body">I ask you a question</p>
<p class="body">This is not</p>
<p class="body">To corner you to insult you to do something</p>
<p class="body">Question is the only way to dig deeper, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Like you know, like people have their experiences, their opinions about everything in the universe</p>
<p class="body">For example, before coming here, a whole lot of people calling him sadhguru don't go on Joe Rogan show</p>
<p class="body">Why are you going there? </p>
<p class="body">Sadhguru you know what he is</p>
<p class="body">I said whatever he is, let me go and find out what the hell he is</p>
<p class="body">Why are you telling me who he is? </p>
<p class="body">Alright, well no, no</p>
<p class="body">He thinks this</p>
<p class="body">He thinks that well if he thinks I'm a chimpanzee, I will prove I'm a very good one</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying I have worked in prisons</p>
<p class="body">You know, like we have a program called inner freedom for imprison both in United States</p>
<p class="body">We worked, but then we stepped out of US in India. Our programs are mandatory in all the South Indian prisons</p>
<p class="body">Really, yeah, and I worked with really hard code ******** you know criminals who have been convicted for murder and more</p>
<p class="body">They have done terrible things, but when they are with me they are such wonderful guys</p>
<p class="body">Lively and fantastic guys</p>
<p class="body">But if you meet them and they are angry or dissatisfied, they may be terrible if you meet them when they are happy and joyful, they are fantastic people</p>
<p class="body">So I'm saying every human being has opinions about everything</p>
<p class="body">This is one thing I've done in</p>
<p class="body">My life is</p>
<p class="body">People who are with me for 25 thirty 40 years with me right next to me. I've it's very difficult for people to understand this. I have not formed a single opinion about them</p>
<p class="body">Every day I look at them fresh</p>
<p class="body">This is very important, yes, so when I sit here I look at you fresh</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter what you have done because what you are going to be tomorrow is what is important, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When you're experiencing these prisoners, do you think that that's part of the problem? </p>
<p class="body">With having had a horrible past, you know, having been a criminal, having been a murderer is that you can never really get past those experiences, and a lot of people eyes they don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's that's</p>
<p class="body">Not true see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They don't experience you fresh</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">See it see</p>
<p class="body">The societies are made in a certain way where unfortunately certain people can't fit in alright, not necessarily because it's in a very American thing</p>
<p class="body">This is a good guy</p>
<p class="body">This is a bad</p>
<p class="body">Guy, I don't look at life like that</p>
<p class="body">It is just that in a given moment, if somebody makes one wrong judgment, he utters something, or he does something in that moment that may end up in the prison</p>
<p class="body">I've met hundreds of them, thousands of them</p>
<p class="body">Most of them are absolutely wonderful guys</p>
<p class="body">There are few who are mentally pathologically somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">That's different, right? </p>
<p class="body">But rest of them</p>
<p class="body">It's a given moment</p>
<p class="body">They make wrong judgments because that's all they know at that given</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think that the practice of yoga can reform people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh yes, of course I will tell you</p>
<p class="body">I will tell you this</p>
<p class="body">See when I first went into the prison in Coimbatore to teach</p>
<p class="body">Don't mistake me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And it was very difficult to get him</p>
<p class="body">I discovered that</p>
0:00:08 <h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Within the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Part of Coimbatore city, there was a prison central prison, so I said let me go and see who is inside. I want to work with them. About 28 years ago</p>
<p class="body">And then I found it took me over two years to get inside</p>
<p class="body">It's so difficult to get in</p>
<p class="body">You need qualifications</p>
<p class="body">You know I was not qualified</p>
<p class="body">It took all kinds of permissions to get inside because this was a high security prison</p>
<p class="body">Then once I got in, everybody said all the prison officers who knew me</p>
<p class="body">They said Sadhguru, you're wasting your time here every Sunday</p>
<p class="body">Christian priest come all these guys do his mischief on Hindu festivals</p>
<p class="body">Hindu people come, they do more mischief and Muslims come more mischief</p>
<p class="body">Other kinds of service organizations come more mischief is all you will get</p>
<p class="body">You'll just waste your time here</p>
<p class="body">Please don't do this</p>
<p class="body">I said you just give Me 2 hours</p>
<p class="body">So there were 12 wards in the QT prison, each with about 200 prisoners. So I took the long term prisoners one ward with 200 people</p>
<p class="body">So when I went there, I said they wanted to put them in the C normally prism</p>
<p class="body">In there they pushed them into one Holland</p>
<p class="body">So sit down here</p>
<p class="body">So the guru has come</p>
<p class="body">I said no</p>
<p class="body">Just I want to meet them on the ground outside</p>
<p class="body">They are all sitting there like this</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, OK, who's this guy was coming? </p>
<p class="body">You know they have a certain</p>
<p class="body">This is an anger and angst against the society which is locked him up</p>
<p class="body">It's very difficult for people to understand what this is</p>
<p class="body">I'm not, not once I've gone into prison and come out without tears in my eyes because</p>
<p class="body">Everything seems normal</p>
<p class="body">On the surface there is pain in the air</p>
<p class="body">Just this is so important for a human being to be free you</p>
<p class="body">Know yes</p>
<p class="body">Just nothing else</p>
<p class="body">Food is good, they get food better than probably their homes</p>
<p class="body">Everything is controlled</p>
<p class="body">They're all very fit, actually much more fitter than the outside people</p>
<p class="body">But there is pain in the air</p>
<p class="body">Just it's so painful so I went there and we played a game with them</p>
<p class="body">They were just surprised that I'm playing a game with them</p>
<p class="body">We played dodgeball</p>
<p class="body">With the guys within about 10-15 minutes, they have forgot their. You know, prison like little children there screaming and yelling and playing like crazy</p>
<p class="body">And then I told them see I want to stay here for 10 days and work with you. You won't believe 80% of them in two hours time. They're all crying. They said don't go you stay with us</p>
<p class="body">And then we started the program. Since then, continuously last 27 years programs have been going on</p>
<p class="body">Most of them are, you know, school dropouts</p>
<p class="body">They're not really very literate and educated</p>
<p class="body">But they wrote thousands of poems</p>
<p class="body">One one guy who killed three people in the courtroom so he was in the courtroom</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">In the courtroom though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">He killed three people</p>
<p class="body">Some vengeance</p>
<p class="body">Issue, you know? </p>
<p class="body">So he's on the death row</p>
<p class="body">See, prison is quite a normal society during the daytime</p>
<p class="body">It's evening 6:00 o'clock</p>
<p class="body">There they have to go inside and the doors are locked</p>
<p class="body">Even if the medical emergency nobody can open those doors unless a magistrate gives permission</p>
<p class="body">The local officer cannot open the gate even if the guy is dying inside</p>
<p class="body">It cannot be opened no matter what happens</p>
<p class="body">That's the law</p>
<p class="body">So he wrote a poem which stuck in my mind</p>
<p class="body">He said every day when the cell door closed, I thought this is my grave</p>
<p class="body">But now I see it's become my Bodhi tree and the gate when the door closes, I close my eyes and I'm in a completely different space altogether</p>
<p class="body">This is my freedom</p>
<p class="body">And now after after about six years he was executed</p>
<p class="body">And we also took local industry and promised them that you know when they come out, they'll be jobs for them</p>
<p class="body">Those who can come out after a few years because in India life term is 20 years, not life life</p>
<p class="body">And in 20 years, if there's good behavior 14 years, they'll get a remission</p>
<p class="body">So many of them who have been there for murder in 14 years time they will come out so nobody gives them a job everywhere</p>
<p class="body">Everybody looks at them suspiciously</p>
<p class="body">So we set up their local businesses to include them into their factories and businesses so that they're not going to commit murder every day</p>
<p class="body">It's just happened once in their lifetime</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So how? </p>
<p class="body">How does yoga reform these people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is all it is to tell me if you're feeling very happy right now</p>
<p class="body">Will you go and beat up? </p>
<p class="body">That guy, Jamie</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let me know even if I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Was mad, even if he's somebody that you don't like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I love Jamie</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, it's not him anybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh anybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When you're joyful, will you go and simply beat up that guy? </p>
<p class="body">No something nasty happening within you</p>
<p class="body">Anger your anger, frustration, something that's when you do ugly things, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah well yeah sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is true for every human</p>
<p class="body">So you you just label somebody as a criminal</p>
<p class="body">What you need to understand is this is a deep rooted unhappiness or frustration or something that's built up because of social reasons or parental reasons or genetic reasons</p>
<p class="body">There's so many, OK, not one aspect</p>
<p class="body">Somewhere this life is unhappy</p>
<p class="body">Frustrated, angry now it wants to do something unpleasant</p>
<p class="body">If this life is feeling very pleasant, why will it do unpleasant things? </p>
<p class="body">So this is all we have focused too much in this world</p>
<p class="body">On trying to produce good human beings</p>
<p class="body">Good human beings</p>
<p class="body">Have caused terrible things</p>
<p class="body">People who think they are good</p>
<p class="body">They have done the worst possible things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's a lot of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Thinking they are good</p>
<p class="body">If we focus on creating joyful and sensible human beings</p>
<p class="body">A whole lot of trouble will</p>
<p class="body">Go away in the world</p>
<p class="body">This is what yoga is about that you're pleasant within yourself when you are feeling pleasant, you do pleasant things naturally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, so you create</p>
<p class="body">This environment where people learn to be pleasant</p>
<p class="body">Or you help them cultivate that pleasantness</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not an environment, it is you understand</p>
<p class="body">Human experience is coming from within me, see right now</p>
<p class="body">Let's say we are working together and I'm oppressive, whatever and you think you're unhappy because of me</p>
<p class="body">But if you realize, see my unhappiness is my doing</p>
<p class="body">You will undo it, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">You think your unhappiness is because of me? </p>
<p class="body">It goes on and on because</p>
<p class="body">It's under my control now</p>
<p class="body">The day you realize my unhappiness, the source of my unhappiness, unhappiness is me, not somebody else</p>
<p class="body">And you take charge of that aspect there</p>
<p class="body">Is there is a method to do that</p>
<p class="body">Once you do that, you are happy</p>
<p class="body">Once you are happy by your own nature then you will do what is most needed, because once you are very happy you have no pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">Your life is an expression of joy, not in pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">This is the shift that needs to happen in the world right now</p>
<p class="body">People are in pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">If your life becomes an expression of your joy rather than being pursuit of happiness, you will Start Stop squeezing the world the way you're squeezing it</p>
<p class="body">This soil, this environment, these problems everything is</p>
<p class="body">In pursuit of human happiness and well being</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think that the physical practice of yoga, meaning the exercise aspect of it, alleviates tension and allows people to relax enough to look at their life in a different way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If they do it properly, yes</p>
<p class="body">When they, when I say properly</p>
<p class="body">Some people are trying to do it like anaerobic exercise</p>
<p class="body">No, we teach what is called as classical yoga</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to do all these very difficult postures and all that</p>
<p class="body">Most yogis master only one posture</p>
<p class="body">People don't know this in this country, only one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">One posture like what posture? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Sure, anything they will choose one posture and they will just master that</p>
<p class="body">So actually in the you know the traditionally what yoga says is if you master one posture, that means generally</p>
2 hours, 40 minutes</p>
<p class="body">If you can sit one way without any sense of discomfort, irritation, agitation, nothing in your system, this is your posture</p>
<p class="body">You just master that one posture, then the rest of the yoga is internal</p>
<p class="body">Physical body is only that much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So most yogis just have one thing that they do and they can do it for hours</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, if they can</p>
<p class="body">If you can sit here, see what it means is your body is not in the vein</p>
<p class="body">Your body, yeah see right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is not in</p>
<p class="body">The way that it's still there pudding</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You want to be happy, but your thought is in the way your emotion is in the way your body is in the way</p>
<p class="body">So once you put the body away, you must understand</p>
<p class="body">In yoga there is no such thing as mind</p>
<p class="body">There is physical body</p>
<p class="body">There is mental body</p>
<p class="body">If your body is not in the way, suddenly you discover that even your mind is not in the way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How do you think they figured this out? </p>
<p class="body">This is getting back to this you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Kind of went around that, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This this happened over 15,000 years ago. The first Yogi he's referred to as the Adiyogi today. To honor him we have set up 112 feet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Tall bust of Adi Yogi</p>
<p class="body">In India, you must look him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
112 feet tall bust what part of India? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You can look him up</p>
<p class="body">Audio guy</p>
<p class="body">In southern India, Enquanto in Tamil Nadu. So this is 112 feet because he gave 112 methods</p>
<p class="body">As to how? </p>
<p class="body">So this is what to say this is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
1000 years ago I figured</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This out over 15,000 years ago</p>
<p class="body">Bear saying this over 15,000 years ago because of they talked about certain celestial happenings. Those happenings have been confirmed today as well over 15,000 years ago and we have iconographic proof of something like 12,400 years. Yeah, that's odd</p>
112 feet tall</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Great hair</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a crazy statue, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This design this is this was designed by me and built by all volunteers inside the center, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How old is that statue? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Really so is that, uh? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Where was building? </p>
<p class="body">So can you go inside of? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is just</p>
<p class="body">That you can go inside, but there's no building inside because it's metal</p>
<p class="body">It gets very hot inside</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wow, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Beautiful. The idea was when I designed this it took Me 2 1/2 years to design this face</p>
<p class="body">You're not seeing the face very clearly</p>
<p class="body">Let's see if we can get a picture where the</p>
<p class="body">Face is clear</p>
<p class="body">It's very yeah maybe yeah</p>
<p class="body">So I wanted intoxication, stillness and exuberance on one face. So it took Me 2 1/2 years</p>
<p class="body">To design this</p>
<p class="body">Face, what do you think it has these qualities? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I think this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I think you nailed it</p>
<p class="body">How was this constructed? </p>
<p class="body">This is all metal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's all metal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How did how was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It made so we made this. It took us some 680 tons of steel</p>
<p class="body">Now we are doing another one near Bangalore, the same one. But now we are doing it with almost 170 tons less because now we figured out the design much better</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wow, wow</p>
<p class="body">That's incredible though</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it really is gorgeous, and that's all</p>
<p class="body">Is it welded together? </p>
<p class="body">Like how is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, see</p>
<p class="body">We say you can see some patchwork here</p>
<p class="body">You're not seeing it, but actually the metal pieces are all about this much size</p>
<p class="body">We could have removed that we could have, we know, braced that and removed that, but when I looked at it, the roughness of it looked better than a smooth face, so I just left it as it is</p>
<p class="body">So there are</p>
<p class="body">Patches so you can</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And the construction method when you're saying it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, you can see the construction material</p>
<p class="body">Not really that visible, but you can see for an observer you can see that which gives a kind of roughness</p>
<p class="body">To the statue</p>
<p class="body">Not very smooth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this Yogi, the device is 112</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So when he came, he appeared somewhere in Himalayas and</p>
<p class="body">People saw that he was dancing wildly in ecstatic states, completely oblivious to everything around him</p>
<p class="body">Or he sat still</p>
<p class="body">For days on end weeks on end he just sat, still unmoving</p>
<p class="body">So initially a lot of thousands of people gathered some miracle is happening, but slowly because he didn't perform any miracles, no fireworks happened, people got bored and they left</p>
<p class="body">Only seven disciples hung on because they saw the greatest miracle</p>
<p class="body">He's the man is not getting up for food, water, toilet, nothing</p>
<p class="body">That means he's beyond the physical nature</p>
<p class="body">He just sat there for months on end</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes the only sign of his aliveness was tears of ecstasy were dribbled dribbling down his cheeks</p>
<p class="body">That was the only sign of life</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise he looked like he's dead</p>
<p class="body">So when he came to his some moments when he came to his consciousness, they pleaded they wanted to learn</p>
<p class="body">What is it that is happening to you? </p>
<p class="body">So he tried to be dismissive</p>
<p class="body">He didn't want to be in touch with them, but when they hung on, when they persisted then he put them on a preparatory kind of work</p>
<p class="body">They went through the preparatory work and then he started expounding for many years</p>
<p class="body">What is the science of how human mechanism is made? </p>
<p class="body">And you won't believe this? </p>
100 and 150 years ago, Charles Darwin talked about evolutionary process</p>
<p class="body">Over 15,000 years ago he spoke something which is parallel to Darwin's theory of evolution. Even today every Indian knows about Indian person knows about this. There are 10 authors</p>
<p class="body">Avatar means not the movie that you saw</p>
<p class="body">Avatar means a manifestation</p>
<p class="body">So 10 hours, our first avatar is called Match Avatar, which means the life was in the form of fish or it was water</p>
<p class="body">It was in the</p>
<p class="body">Water, the second one is</p>
<p class="body">Gourmet author, which means it's a turtle that means it became an amphibious life</p>
<p class="body">The third one is a wild war</p>
<p class="body">It's called where hotter it you know other small things happen, but the mammals came, then the next one is called narashima who is half man half animal</p>
<p class="body">Next one is a doffed man, woman author</p>
<p class="body">The next one is a full grown man, but Awala tile man. He's so angry and so crazy over fighting man that always he went about chopping off people to he got so angry and he lopped off his own mother's head</p>
<p class="body">So the next one is a peaceful man, is, uh, Rama, author</p>
<p class="body">He's a peaceful gentleman</p>
<p class="body">The next one is a loving man</p>
<p class="body">Krishna avatar, the next one is a Buddha avatar who's a meditative man</p>
<p class="body">The next one the 10th one is supposed to be the mystical man</p>
<p class="body">These are not individual people to be seen these. This is the evolution of life on the planet. If you look at Darwin's theory of evolution somewhere, it runs parallel to this from waterborne life to amphibious life too</p>
<p class="body">This way half man half animal dwarfed man like this it is grown so he talked about this and he said see if you want to evolve further</p>
<p class="body">Then something in relationship to the Earth and the sun must change</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise, physiologically, you're not going to evolve further, but you have a consciousness with which you can transform yourself absolutely and become completely different from what you are right now</p>
<p class="body">Right now, you're available to all the forces of nature</p>
<p class="body">Right now, in many ways you are enslaved to what's happening around you</p>
<p class="body">You can rise above this and evolve consciously</p>
<p class="body">But physiological evolution has come to a standstill because planetary movement and who you are right now, the the planet and the solar system is functioning like a Potter's wheel. To make this happen</p>
<p class="body">This life, like a Potter's wheel, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Like what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Potter's wheel, Potter's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wheel yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's functioning like that</p>
<p class="body">It's got new to this place, so people ask can we can we develop more intelligence? </p>
<p class="body">Can we become bigger than this? </p>
<p class="body">He says no</p>
<p class="body">Physiologically, your evolution has come to a place, unless there is some serious change in the relationship between the planet and the</p>
<p class="body">Son, that will not happen, but consciously you can evolve. So then he propounds 112 ways as to how you can do it. 112 distinct ways, how you can do it</p>
<p class="body">So that is how yoga started</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Who do you think this person was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">These are the Yogi</p>
<p class="body">If they called him because he never introduced himself, they called him Yogi because he was the first one</p>
<p class="body">They called him adiyogi</p>
<p class="body">Adiyogi means the first Yogi</p>
<p class="body">And he is also referred to as Shiva</p>
<p class="body">Shiva means one who is not</p>
<p class="body">That which is not in the sense see today. Modern science is speaking in these terms in an atom. For example, over 99% of it is empty space</p>
<p class="body">That is proton, neutron, electron. All that covers less than one percent, 99% is empty space, so it is in the cosmos</p>
99% is empty space. See right now you look at this ceiling and you think it's full of star like lights, but actually there's more empty space than lights, isn't it? But because our visual apparatus are in a certain</p>
<p class="body">Certain way, designed in a certain way, it gives more prominence to light because that's what we see more clearly</p>
<p class="body">So he said everything is like this</p>
<p class="body">So if you transcend your physical nature, you become a Shiva</p>
<p class="body">That means you are nothing, but nothing is the most powerful dimension of the existence because it is in the lap of the nothingness</p>
<p class="body">Everything is happening</p>
<p class="body">What you call as everything is just 1%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think this was a real person of a real individual, or do you think it's representative of the the learning of yoga and the best way to establish it to express it was to make it a person? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a real person because the places where he came, what he spoke, everything is recorded in history, largely by lore</p>
<p class="body">Today people are trying to write it down in books because in India we don't believe in scholarship</p>
<p class="body">We believe in experience in our experience, so it's always transmitted as a oral tradition for a long time</p>
<p class="body">These days people are writing down in many ways</p>
<p class="body">It was a real person because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The credit for spectacular human being</p>
<p class="body">If they could do all the things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Absolutely see when he came down South in southern India at that time, people were way shorter than the northern people</p>
<p class="body">So they say he was twice the height of an average South Indian woman</p>
<p class="body">So they say he must have been because an average South Indian woman tribal woman were like four or four and a half feet</p>
<p class="body">So he must have been seven or eight feet tall that people said he was twice that, and they say when he stood next to your horse, he was as tall as the horses ears</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But do you think these are exaggerations, do you think? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, exaggerations could be there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What do you think this is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But because his physical size doesn't mean anything for his yoga, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But why? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So there is no point exaggerating that aspect</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying right? </p>
<p class="body">So if he was a warrior, somebody may exaggerate him, but for a Yogi, what is the point making him a big? </p>
<p class="body">Guy, physically it's a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">To make him divine so so physically unique</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, that that is the whole thing, see</p>
<p class="body">In India? </p>
<p class="body">The Indian culture</p>
<p class="body">If you are on the spiritual path, we call you a seeker</p>
<p class="body">If you ascribe to religion, we call you a believer</p>
<p class="body">Alright, belief means something that you do not know because an authority speaks you believe that it could be your father who says that this is the truth and you believe in me as a child</p>
<p class="body">Then it may be a priest, then it may be somebody bigger</p>
<p class="body">Or it may be in a book you believe it because it comes from an authority, but the nature of that culture</p>
<p class="body">The eastern culture sees</p>
<p class="body">There is no authority for us</p>
<p class="body">Truth is the only authority</p>
<p class="body">Authority is never the truth, so that is the essence of Eastern mysticism and eastern spirituality</p>
<p class="body">That it is</p>
<p class="body">You're always a seeker, never a believer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you think that yoga just emanated from this one incredibly unique human being that was larger than everybody else? </p>
<p class="body">That had supernatural abilities that existed 15,000 years ago</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See now you're making a superhuman being out of somebody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But making an 8 foot tall person who can go for days on end without drinking water? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, you see there have been so there have been people like that</p>
<p class="body">Alright, in every culture there have been physically large people, but physical physical size</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there have been people that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Has nothing to do with these capabilities because the abilities</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, but the capabilities are super physical too, aren't they? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, this is what it's about</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is not about being superhuman</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is about realizing being human is super</p>
<p class="body">That's what is important, so that's the whole thing that he's saying</p>
<p class="body">How being human is so super</p>
<p class="body">If you explore your humanity to its fullest, you will become so fantastic</p>
<p class="body">Being a human being itself is a fantastic feat</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to act like a super human being</p>
<p class="body">He did not perform any miracles</p>
<p class="body">He did not do anything</p>
<p class="body">He just taught them how to be beyond the limitations of 1's physical and psychological structures. That's all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think if this person didn't exist that yoga still would have been invented without him? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Of course, somebody else would have</p>
<p class="body">After that many, many yogis have come, but he is the maybe even before there were people</p>
<p class="body">But they did not speak or they did not gather disciples who would take</p>
<p class="body">So he sent his seven disciples in seven different directions</p>
<p class="body">One was sent to southern India, who is today</p>
<p class="body">We hold him as the father of Southern mysticism</p>
<p class="body">He's August amone</p>
<p class="body">Who came down South and he did maximum amount of work there</p>
<p class="body">Every human habitation he touched at that time and brought</p>
<p class="body">Spiritual process as a living practice, not as a separate practice, just the way you say it, that just the way you do things, just the way you address each other</p>
<p class="body">Was made into a spiritual process</p>
<p class="body">See right now in India</p>
<p class="body">If people go to the temple and whatever their favorite deity</p>
<p class="body">If they worship, they will stand like this</p>
<p class="body">If anybody comes also, they'll stand like this</p>
<p class="body">If a dog comes also, they'll do this</p>
<p class="body">If they see a rock also, they'll do this</p>
<p class="body">They see a tree</p>
<p class="body">Also, they'll do this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">For the people just listening, you're holding your hands together in prayer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not in prayer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, this way whatever you're doing with your hand</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is done to everybody</p>
<p class="body">Alright, so because spiritual process is not alien to the life that you live, the way you live has to become spiritual</p>
<p class="body">It's not that you have a spiritual practice and you</p>
<p class="body">Have a separate life</p>
<p class="body">It is the same thing you you integrate it into your life</p>
<p class="body">So he did that</p>
<p class="body">Another one stayed with him, another one came to the northern part of India</p>
<p class="body">Another one went to Central Asia</p>
<p class="body">There are, you know there are certain footprints office another when went to North Africa, another went to South Asia, another when another one came to</p>
<p class="body">South America 
<p class="body">Wherever these yogis went, suddenly those cultures where they went saw a sudden upsurge in the knowledge of geometry</p>
<p class="body">Wherever you see extraordinary sense of geometry which is not in line with the tribal existence that they had, that means a Yogi</p>
<p class="body">Same that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Sense of geometry</p>
<p class="body">Meaning like the structures that they built architecture</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, structures that they build artifacts</p>
<p class="body">They created the way they arranged things around themselves</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly they had a different sense of geometry because yoga is essentially a cosmic geometry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Cosmic geometry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">In to align yourself in line with the cosmos so that it reverberates as the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Which brings us to UFO's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">There is some substance and a lot of imagination with this UFO business</p>
<p class="body">We are always thinking life, you know, like all this I'm I'm saying this not with any</p>
<p class="body">There are many people who could have experienced something who could have seen something</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying generally the popular imagination of a UFO or craft will come on land somebody will</p>
<p class="body">Come out of it</p>
<p class="body">So you're thinking like this because that's how human beings operate alright</p>
<p class="body">That we will go land somewhere</p>
<p class="body">Then the door opens</p>
<p class="body">We come out</p>
<p class="body">How do you know that? </p>
<p class="body">Is how they also do it? </p>
<p class="body">That's not how it is</p>
<p class="body">I have living experience with certain extraterrestrial lifeforms</p>
<p class="body">You do</p>
<p class="body">There are a whole lot of videos which I've spoken about</p>
<p class="body">I have a reputation of being very logically correct now</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to lose it by talking about it to everybody, but in exclusive groups have spoken in detail</p>
<p class="body">I've made other people experience these things very profound experiences of life</p>
<p class="body">Which is not of this planet, but it's not like a craft will land</p>
<p class="body">They'll open the door, they'll come out</p>
<p class="body">This is all your own thing</p>
<p class="body">You parked the car, you opened the door, you locked the door</p>
<p class="body">You came out</p>
<p class="body">This is your thinking, alright</p>
<p class="body">It is not necessary</p>
<p class="body">Other life should operate the way we operate</p>
<p class="body">It is nothing like where we are</p>
<p class="body">It's something totally different</p>
<p class="body">So people have seen things here and there</p>
<p class="body">Some of it could be mistake</p>
<p class="body">Some of it could be exaggeration</p>
<p class="body">Some of it could be just total lies, but definitely some people have seen something some people have experienced something</p>
<p class="body">There is no denying everybody will not be lying</p>
<p class="body">There is no denying it is there</p>
<p class="body">But we are thinking just the way we are</p>
<p class="body">They will also be all we can think is a little bigger ears, little bigger eyes, maybe three eyes instead of two</p>
<p class="body">This is just exaggeration of what we already know</p>
<p class="body">Leave the imaginations aside</p>
<p class="body">Is there life beyond us? </p>
<p class="body">It would be very pompous to believe that in such a vast core cosmos, we are the only evolved life on the planet in the universe is itself a very pompous belief system</p>
<p class="body">Definitely there is more life and</p>
<p class="body">You know it is</p>
<p class="body">It is done</p>
<p class="body">We have done things with it in the past</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We've done things with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It yes, we've done some experiments with such life</p>
<p class="body">We have made people experience this very strongly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">When you say, wait who do? </p>
<p class="body">You mean we as a group? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We have done certain things you yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So how? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't go into</p>
<p class="body">It why not? </p>
<p class="body">I have a reputation of being very logically correct</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, if you're logically correct about extraterrestrials, wouldn't that be beneficial to people? </p>
<p class="body">That are hearing this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, there are</p>
<p class="body">See, our logic is related to our</p>
<p class="body">Existence the way we are made</p>
<p class="body">Yes, the way the existence is made doesn't fit into our logic</p>
<p class="body">This is the biggest mistake that modern societies are making</p>
<p class="body">You are trying to fit the existence into your logic</p>
<p class="body">No, your logic has place in the existence</p>
<p class="body">Existence cannot be</p>
<p class="body">You can't fit it into your logic</p>
<p class="body">Because your logic functions between binaries of two</p>
<p class="body">You and me have to be there for logic</p>
<p class="body">The whole spiritual experience itself is not logically correct because the experience of life is beyond two</p>
<p class="body">There are no binaries in spiritual process</p>
<p class="body">When I use the word spiritual, I'm not using the word spiritual the way religions are using</p>
<p class="body">They're talking about a spirit</p>
<p class="body">Which goes and comes and whatever not in that sense, if you experience your life</p>
<p class="body">Beyond your physiological and psychological construct</p>
<p class="body">Then your spiritual</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you mentioned it, which is already the most difficult thing to do now to talk about it</p>
<p class="body">You feel like would somehow or another discredit you</p>
<p class="body">I don't understand that because just because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I have to be logically correct, otherwise you cannot speak pleasant</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But how are you experiencing this? </p>
<p class="body">Thing can you? </p>
<p class="body">Just tell me how you're experiencing these things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See in certain spaces</p>
<p class="body">Uh, there are very strong presence, which is when you feel the texture of that life</p>
<p class="body">You know it is not like anything that we know here</p>
<p class="body">Obviously it doesn't belong here it is</p>
<p class="body">It has a different source than the life that we are</p>
<p class="body">When I say the life that we are</p>
<p class="body">See, this is the yogic sciences</p>
<p class="body">This will confuse people if we go that far because people are thinking</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is far backache</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is for health</p>
<p class="body">You guys for</p>
<p class="body">Slimming down, we've like this, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Very established, that's not the case</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So yoga means you know the texture of life</p>
<p class="body">That is one thing I'm talking about</p>
<p class="body">The texture of this life</p>
<p class="body">If you know the texture of</p>
<p class="body">This life</p>
<p class="body">OK, so people ask me how do you know all this? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">There's only one thing I know</p>
<p class="body">I know the nature of this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate because every other life is in some way built the same way</p>
<p class="body">People think I know every other life</p>
<p class="body">No, I know only this life</p>
<p class="body">But fortunately every other life from a single microbe to a human being, to every other creature</p>
<p class="body">In some ways, a reflection of this life because it's all connected</p>
<p class="body">Even the evolutionary sciences are saying the same thing</p>
<p class="body">Even the religions are saying the same thing, all right</p>
<p class="body">In that sense, I know the texture of this life and that life and every other life here, but there are some lives which don't have the texture which are totally different</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And how are you experiencing these lives? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You want me to say something ridiculous? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I don't think it's ridiculous at all, no no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, if I say something which is illogical, it will seem ridiculous, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't think it's illogical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It will be logical because it will not fit into the framework of human logic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">While the framework of human logic is based on our own experience and interpretation of the life that we lived, it doesn't mean that other people haven't experienced or interpreted something that is beyond our comprehension</p>
<p class="body">Because we haven't experienced it personally</p>
<p class="body">I think that's logical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We we have done experiments where</p>
<p class="body">We attracted certain</p>
<p class="body">Certain life which is not which doesn't have any texture of earthly life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And how do you conduct these experiments? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We I used certain people to</p>
<p class="body">Invite them into their bodies and what happened there is totally</p>
<p class="body">Unbelievable for people because I'll tell you a simple thing. I invited a certain life into one person's body</p>
<p class="body">I kept the weather was already like nearly zero</p>
<p class="body">Kind of subzero kind of atmosphere</p>
<p class="body">It was in Tibet</p>
<p class="body">And I kept a bowl of water about 3 inches above the head</p>
<p class="body">And when this life entered and I tried to hold it within that body, you won't believe this bowl which is 3 inches</p>
<p class="body">The person is lying down on the ground on wet soil</p>
<p class="body">You know they just put a bed sheet and this person is lying down</p>
<p class="body">This bowl is about 3 inches above the head on the ground</p>
<p class="body">The water started boiling</p>
<p class="body">There are over 200 people watching the water boiling, all right</p>
<p class="body">Because it created so much heat, then I let it go because it could burn up the person you know, choose out that person in some ways because the moment it felt trapped it created such heat</p>
<p class="body">The water is actually boiling 3 inches away</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did you film this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">From the bottom</p>
<p class="body">From a distance they've filmed it bad filming</p>
<p class="body">You know they were not really looking for it, but it is there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And how many times has this happened? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We did this about two times</p>
<p class="body">We did it properly</p>
<p class="body">Another time we did a mild 1</p>
<p class="body">After that I thought I will go spend time there, which has never happened</p>
<p class="body">And above all</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't serve any purpose like that</p>
<p class="body">You know it doesn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Serve a purpose to experiment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It doesn't say it is</p>
<p class="body">It is more to</p>
<p class="body">No, not</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't serve a purpose as to how you can use because it could be</p>
<p class="body">I I have to admit I was stepping into a area where I don't know damn thing</p>
<p class="body">OK, so you could make a mistake and take somebody's life or your own life or something like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So whatever these life forms are that you're experiencing, they they're only you can only experience them through another person's body</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no no</p>
<p class="body">Not like that only because I experienced</p>
<p class="body">I wanted to demonstrate it to the people who were</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Watching and how did you know that it was a thing? </p>
<p class="body">Like how did you know that you could experience it that way and it exhibit it? </p>
<p class="body">Put it on display for the</p>
<p class="body">People that are watching</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See your whole perception right now</p>
<p class="body">For most human being is limited to five senses</p>
<p class="body">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, this is how you know</p>
<p class="body">The world</p>
<p class="body">If something has no smell, no taste, no touch</p>
<p class="body">You won't know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But there could be an infinite number of senses that we're not aware of that we don't possess</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh yes, yes</p>
<p class="body">So these things are faced in many places, but there are certain places where there is a</p>
<p class="body">Unreasonable level of concentration</p>
<p class="body">So one place is this Kailash Mansarovar region in Tibet</p>
<p class="body">In last two years we've been not being able to go because the Chinese have closed this because of this corona virus or whatever</p>
<p class="body">Probably next year it'll open up</p>
<p class="body">Last year we went</p>
<p class="body">We viewed Colossian Manasarovar from 8 to 10 kilometres away at the Nepali border we went there and</p>
<p class="body">Even from a distance, what it does to people is unbelievable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So it's just one concentrated hotspot</p>
<p class="body">Yeah of activity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, and that too, it's like clockwork exactly 2:30 in the morning it starts</p>
<p class="body">Boom activity like that for about 1 1/2 hours. One hour 40 minutes like that. After that it just goes down</p>
<p class="body">It's almost like a busy airport boom, boom boom, boom things are happening but not like crafts or anything, just bunches of lives just up and down</p>
<p class="body">Things happening for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours Max</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think there are extraterrestrial? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think they're interdimensional? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think? </p>
<p class="body">They're spirits</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They're not spirits, no, no</p>
<p class="body">Anything that's related to the planet</p>
<p class="body">We will just know immediately</p>
<p class="body">It's not a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Something that's from somewhere else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is definitely from somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">And you know, like</p>
<p class="body">These are crazy things, man, why do you want me to speak about this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So I don't think that that crazy</p>
<p class="body">I think they're only crazy because we haven't experienced them</p>
<p class="body">If you tried to explain</p>
<p class="body">Many of the things that we take for granted because they're normal</p>
<p class="body">To someone who's never experienced in them, like if you tried to experience fire to someone who had never experienced fire, it would be the craziest idea that you could run across them that there's a thing that's not alive</p>
<p class="body">But it consumes things and it could kill all life on this planet</p>
<p class="body">But it could also serve a purpose</p>
<p class="body">To heat your home and cook your food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is what I'm saying</p>
<p class="body">In in yoga there are three types of fires within you</p>
<p class="body">It is jitter Agni chit Agni boutigny jitter</p>
<p class="body">Agni means the fire of stomach and the reproductive aspect</p>
<p class="body">These two fires, which keep your survival going</p>
<p class="body">Chit Agni is the fire of your intelligence which propels a human being to do so many things</p>
<p class="body">Boutigny is the fire of five elements of Earth</p>
<p class="body">Earth, water, air, fire and space</p>
<p class="body">These five elements, which is the composite of what everything physical is</p>
<p class="body">So these three fires</p>
<p class="body">Only if you keep them in control right now you know, for example, we're talking about the soil</p>
<p class="body">These whole civilizations have been built because of our gastronomic fire</p>
<p class="body">And our intellectual fire</p>
<p class="body">The same gastronomic fire, if it's unquenched it can burn the world down</p>
<p class="body">Right now UN agencies</p>
<p class="body">Are predicting that by 2035 there will be dozens of civil wars across the world</p>
<p class="body">Because food shortages will cause that</p>
<p class="body">Because this fire is not met means people will set fire to</p>
<p class="body">Each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How did you know that these entities or whatever these things are that you experienced existed? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So I was talking about 5 senses</p>
<p class="body">See for your sense organs to experience anything you need a contrast</p>
<p class="body">Only because there is light you know darkness</p>
<p class="body">If it's all dark, you wouldn't know what his darkness what is like</p>
<p class="body">Only because there is night you know what's your day only because there is a woman</p>
<p class="body">You know what's a man? </p>
<p class="body">Everything is by polarities</p>
<p class="body">If there are no polarities, your eyes, your ears, your anything</p>
<p class="body">Your five senses cannot function</p>
<p class="body">So it is based on the information that these five senses has given you that your whole logical intellect has developed</p>
<p class="body">Without this information</p>
<p class="body">This will not do anything, it's only from the data that you got by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching, your intellect is functioning in a certain way, so right now you can see this part of my hand, but you can't see this part</p>
<p class="body">If you see this spot, you can't see this spot</p>
<p class="body">This is the nature of your</p>
<p class="body">Vision, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Now, if you hear that sound at that moment, you don't hear the silence</p>
<p class="body">So everything is like this</p>
<p class="body">You see only a part of it through sense perception</p>
<p class="body">Because of this, your logic is all in pieces</p>
<p class="body">So with logically if you arrive at</p>
<p class="body">Any conclusion it is like I gave you a million piece jigsaw</p>
<p class="body">You found five pieces</p>
<p class="body">You put them together and say, oh, this is a bear</p>
<p class="body">This is a bear, no, you're in Texas, this is</p>
<p class="body">A horse you said? </p>
<p class="body">Because with five pieces you arrived at some conclusion</p>
<p class="body">This is what intellect means</p>
<p class="body">This is why, in yogic sciences we don't attach any significance to what you think and feel, because out of a million piece jigsaw you found a few pieces and you're making your conclusions</p>
<p class="body">It's not of any relevance for one who wants to know it may be of relevance who one wants to survive</p>
<p class="body">It may be of relevance for one who wants to win a race with somebody else</p>
<p class="body">OK, your heart you figured out the horse better than somebody else</p>
<p class="body">You win the race, but it's not of any relevance for someone who wants to know for a seeker</p>
<p class="body">It's of no relevance</p>
<p class="body">So how to go beyond sense perception? </p>
<p class="body">How to know life beyond sense perception is the entire aspect of yoga, because as long as sense perception is on you and me distinctly separate</p>
<p class="body">No way that is you</p>
<p class="body">This is me</p>
<p class="body">Only if you go beyond sense perception</p>
<p class="body">We were doing this beyond your sensory limitations</p>
<p class="body">If you go something that not you becomes you</p>
<p class="body">Right now with food it's happening</p>
<p class="body">Something, see when it's on your plate</p>
<p class="body">You call this my food when you eat it, you say it's me, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Something that's not you became you</p>
<p class="body">So this is yoga that you understand</p>
<p class="body">The sense perception is dividing the world and this division is needed for your survival process</p>
<p class="body">But this division is no use for you to know life</p>
<p class="body">The way it is</p>
<p class="body">So the yogic sciences are focused on how to transcend the sensory perception, how to suspend your senses and simply perceive life without the division</p>
<p class="body">If you do that, everything that is here will be in some way known to you, and there is so much here that people don't see</p>
<p class="body">If you talk about it, you look like a mumbo jumbo so you know which doctor, so you don't talk about these things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But how did you know that it was going to be in that area? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's not that I knew it's in that area</p>
<p class="body">I had heard stories about that place, but</p>
<p class="body">I thought I'll just go there one time just to see because it's a magnificent place by any standard</p>
<p class="body">It's a beautiful, beautiful place</p>
<p class="body">So it's a little over the lake is around 4400 feet above mean sea level. The Kolosh peak is almost 19,000 feet</p>
<p class="body">So once I went and the magnificent nature of that see the mountain is a place, this is</p>
<p class="body">A yogic tradition that when a Yogi gets to know certain things</p>
<p class="body">He knows he cannot share it</p>
<p class="body">His experience he cannot share it because nobody will understand it</p>
<p class="body">Because it cannot be understood, it can only be experienced</p>
<p class="body">So what he will do is he will store it in an energy form in a place where there is not too much for human footprint at the same time, it's not completely inaccessible</p>
<p class="body">There are many places like this in India</p>
<p class="body">There are places like that in other parts of</p>
<p class="body">The world also</p>
<p class="body">One fantastic place that you must visit is in United States is math opiela</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Where's that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">The number is in Wyoming, Wyoming</p>
<p class="body">Near what Rapid City? </p>
<p class="body">You they they call it the devil's tower you heard of that in many Western movies? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The devil</p>
<p class="body">Towers that from close encounters of the third kind is that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">In I don't know about that movie, but in many Western movies it's always there</p>
<p class="body">It just ends, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's close encounters of the third time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is called Marty Pella</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And in that Steven Spielberg movie</p>
<p class="body">That's a very significant place</p>
'cause that's where the aliens land</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, is that so</p>
<p class="body">So this is a powerful, powerful space in America</p>
<p class="body">This is 1 space I found, which is naturally tremendous, and see this is Kailash</p>
<p class="body">It's a, it is something else, it's</p>
<p class="body">It is the greatest mystical library on the planet, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Place collage</p>
<p class="body">What do you think is going on there? </p>
<p class="body">Uh, what do you think is going? </p>
<p class="body">On there, why is it all concentrated? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is the one thing is Adiyogi himself was there</p>
<p class="body">He lived there so he stored all that he knows there and many other yogis</p>
<p class="body">Later on, many Buddhist teachers like Padma Shamba and Manjushri</p>
<p class="body">All these people and even the Jain monks</p>
<p class="body">They all went and stored their energies there because</p>
<p class="body">The knowledge that they know they don't want it</p>
<p class="body">To be</p>
<p class="body">Lost it can't be transmitted to people because you will not find a suitable people to do that</p>
<p class="body">So you place it somewhere where in future somebody who has the capability will access this</p>
<p class="body">I'll tell you one experience</p>
<p class="body">I'm going into the mumbo jumbo world</p>
<p class="body">Why man, I came</p>
<p class="body">For the same mumbo jumbo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's not mumbled</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I came for safe soil</p>
<p class="body">You getting me somewhere else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We're doing both</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it's mumbo jumbo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, this happened</p>
<p class="body">I was, uh, this is what just thinking the years I'm not good with years</p>
<p class="body">Must be 1010 eleven years ago, maybe 2008 or</p>
<p class="body">Even before that, I'm sorry 2000</p>
<p class="body">Three or four</p>
<p class="body">I started running temperature</p>
<p class="body">I was in India no</p>
<p class="body">First I was in California</p>
<p class="body">I was in Los Angeles</p>
<p class="body">I started running temperature</p>
<p class="body">And I come to speak in the Thai group</p>
<p class="body">You know, there is an Indian group entrepreneurs group</p>
<p class="body">And I spoke there and</p>
<p class="body">The President of the Thai Group invited me to their home again to speak again to another exclusive group</p>
<p class="body">I speaking there, I'm running running very high temperature and I'm</p>
<p class="body">You know my clothes are all wet with sweat</p>
<p class="body">So one man raised his hand</p>
<p class="body">I thought he wants to ask a question</p>
<p class="body">I said fine</p>
<p class="body">He said you need to go to the emergency room right now</p>
<p class="body">I said yes, I know, but I'll finish this doc and go</p>
<p class="body">Then I finished that talk and then I went to the hospital like I was running very high temperature so they gave me this that and they said this is some kind of typhoid</p>
<p class="body">So I met one wonderful Doctor Who was a Tropical Medicine expert</p>
<p class="body">He said this is some strange kind of typhoid, so he gave me a whole lot of antibiotics</p>
<p class="body">This that I took that and then I went to UK where I had a four day residential program</p>
<p class="body">All the four days I was running very high temperature, but I finished that program in this 40 years</p>
<p class="body">I've never cancelled one program because I was not well</p>
<p class="body">I've never done that, so I went back to India. I had a television shoot I had to shoot 52 weeks of material in about four to five days</p>
<p class="body">So from whole day I'm shooting and</p>
<p class="body">If I sit down for 30-40 minutes of shoot, I'm like my whole floor. All my clothes are wet with sweat. I have to change my clothes because I'm sweating so much</p>
<p class="body">And then after shooting the whole day on the second or third day, I came home and I was like feeling like my brains are getting fried up so hot that I</p>
<p class="body">The thermometer and put it</p>
<p class="body">It said one out seven</p>
<p class="body">I thought old man, I'm killing myself right now</p>
<p class="body">So with my entire my clothes, everything I went and should have stood</p>
<p class="body">Under the cold shower</p>
<p class="body">Then I called the doctor and said, you know it was reading one or seven</p>
<p class="body">I stood under the cold shower</p>
<p class="body">So this is the smartest thing you've done in</p>
<p class="body">Your entire life</p>
<p class="body">If you had been in that for another few minutes, you would have a stroke or you would have something for sure</p>
<p class="body">Then they said it's some kind of what malaria? </p>
<p class="body">And they gave me malarial medicine. I had typhoid medicine. Then I got malaria medicine. Then they said three different types of malaria's that diagnosed in one month time and they changed the medication. Change the medication</p>
<p class="body">And then I went to Australia</p>
<p class="body">I was running temperature</p>
<p class="body">I was in Singapore</p>
<p class="body">I was running temperature</p>
<p class="body">I came to India for two days</p>
<p class="body">I was running temperature</p>
<p class="body">Then I came back to United States</p>
<p class="body">So it was my daughter's vacation, so I told her I'll take her to some lake house. Somebody had a friend of ours, so I said I'll take her on a lake</p>
<p class="body">So I have a port, you know, Ivy port running by now I have antibiotic every day running about 3:00 or 4 hours a day with Ivy port on</p>
<p class="body">I'm riding a boat and taking her around and everything going on wow</p>
<p class="body">By then I have done</p>
<p class="body">About 18 blood tests</p>
<p class="body">And about four MRI's all kinds of bizarre things. They're saying and changing the prescription and giving me this medication that medication</p>
<p class="body">Temperature didn't go down, it just went on and on</p>
<p class="body">Then I was in North Carolina on this lake house around 2:00 AM</p>
<p class="body">I knew that I was just kind of collapsing</p>
<p class="body">Gonna kind of we're not dropping off then I I I called out and they called for an ambulance</p>
<p class="body">It came and they took me to a local hospital in Cashiers, in north</p>
<p class="body">In Carolina and these doctors looked at this is they looked at all the blood tests and this is too esoteric for us</p>
<p class="body">You better go to Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">So I went to Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">There they said it's best you go to some physician in New York</p>
<p class="body">He's the best guy</p>
<p class="body">You must go there because by now, almost seven weeks I've been running continuous temperature</p>
<p class="body">I've been traveling</p>
<p class="body">All over the world</p>
<p class="body">So I went to New York and they said, you know, you must get admitted</p>
<p class="body">We'll check</p>
<p class="body">Then I got admitted by then</p>
<p class="body">I can, you know, I'm having difficulty walking</p>
<p class="body">I'm just really got like become weak</p>
<p class="body">Then, and by then my lymph nodes have swollen up so badly excruciating pain</p>
<p class="body">So they said they may have to do surgery and they have to do a biopsy first and see what is it</p>
<p class="body">Is it malignant or whatever? </p>
<p class="body">Then I'm in the hospital next day morning for the it's a general anesthesia</p>
<p class="body">They have a pre check for anesthesia</p>
<p class="body">So in that funny gown which is open on all sides, you know I'm wearing that holding like this and trying to walk holding onto the wall</p>
<p class="body">I got into the elevator to go to another floor</p>
<p class="body">In between, in one floor the lift stopped</p>
<p class="body">A Chinese man got in, so the Doctor Who was with me, introduced</p>
<p class="body">He's the one who is going to do the surgery</p>
<p class="body">For you</p>
<p class="body">Then the Chinese doctor felt the lymph nodes like this and said it's very deep</p>
<p class="body">You must inform the family</p>
<p class="body">Then I went for the test</p>
<p class="body">For the anesthetic tests, then I said I'm going home</p>
<p class="body">Doctor said no, sadhguru, this is very dangerous</p>
<p class="body">You can't leave the</p>
<p class="body">Hospital I said no, I'm going</p>
<p class="body">I said I'll go</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to go through this surgery, so I went back</p>
<p class="body">A friend had an apartment in Manhattan area</p>
<p class="body">I just closed my eyes and sat for four days</p>
<p class="body">My temperature went down, the swelling went down</p>
<p class="body">In 21 days I was in Kailash Trekt</p>
<p class="body">You know my muscle mass had gone down</p>
<p class="body">My legs had become like this</p>
<p class="body">Always I've been walking, trekking, playing games</p>
<p class="body">I've had some muscle not like you, but I have some muscle to keep me going, but my muscle must went down so much in these eight weeks I just shrank like that</p>
<p class="body">With great difficulty, difficulty, I trekked there</p>
<p class="body">I could barely speak</p>
<p class="body">And I sat there for two hours</p>
<p class="body">I took one strand of what is there on that mountain. You won't believe in 2 1/2 hours</p>
<p class="body">I was almost 10 to 15 years younger</p>
<p class="body">Than what I was at that moment</p>
<p class="body">People around me will vouch for it</p>
<p class="body">How suddenly I'm a different man? </p>
<p class="body">After eight weeks of fever and all kinds of treatments, without knowing what it is</p>
<p class="body">So that is the power of that mountain</p>
<p class="body">It's not just to heal you of your health or something</p>
<p class="body">It is tremendous amount of</p>
<p class="body">Everything that one can know in the universe is stored there in some way</p>
<p class="body">It is your ability to pull it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But you were you were covered in Manhattan, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, what makes you think it's that mountain? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, I closed my eyes and I did what I have to do with my system</p>
<p class="body">Which gave me a rest bite</p>
<p class="body">But still I was not fully there, still very weak and like that but I just</p>
<p class="body">Bounce back in 2 1/2 hours time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What is it? </p>
<p class="body">But I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't understand what it has to do with that mountain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, this is what it is</p>
<p class="body">What you think is you is not just contained in the boundaries of this body</p>
<p class="body">If you are willing to open up that boundary</p>
<p class="body">The whole the whole existence is with you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you opened up your body after all those weeks and you don't think it has anything to do with the antibiotics you were taking or that you were finally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Antibiotics didn't give me a respite at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Getting some rest</p>
<p class="body">But you never rest</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm very restful, even if I'm traveling and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But you were constantly working right</p>
<p class="body">You were explaining all the different things you were doing and that you were constantly taxing yourself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but</p>
<p class="body">I do, but</p>
<p class="body">It's awesome</p>
<p class="body">No, I don't text myself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But that was taxing</p>
<p class="body">You were sweating through your clothes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, that's because the fever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You never rest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But but I'm saying this swelling, which they said without looking inside</p>
<p class="body">They will do biopsy, and most probably they'll do surgery along with that</p>
<p class="body">Which was excruciating pain</p>
<p class="body">Just went down when</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But it went down after you rested, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Not rested, I sat with my eyes closed</p>
<p class="body">I didn't sleep</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I sat but you didn't do anything for four days</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you wanted to explain</p>
<p class="body">It This is why I</p>
<p class="body">Said see I'm going into mumbo jumbo land</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, I believe you</p>
<p class="body">I'm not, I'm not</p>
<p class="body">I'm not quite, I'm just trying to piece together why</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So I'm saying when doctors, every every qualified doctor says saying that I'm in a state where you will have to inform the family because I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">In life situations, life and death situation, you don't recover just because four days you sit there with eyes closed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You don't think so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, not because of rest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You think that there was something supernatural or something else? </p>
<p class="body">What is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I I never</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The term you would use</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Used the word supernatural because everything is within the aspect of nature</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, what would you use? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So which aspect of nature are you in right now? </p>
<p class="body">That is the thing, see</p>
<p class="body">One aspect of your nature is survival</p>
<p class="body">For example, for every human being because of survival, you treat to build boundaries around yourself, whether it's a national boundary or a individual boundary, your house boundary, or your personal boundaries</p>
<p class="body">These all you know self preservation boundaries, right? </p>
<p class="body">But there is also something within you which wants to expand, which doesn't lack boundaries</p>
<p class="body">Why people suffer the prison like that is just the boundaries</p>
<p class="body">Nothing else wrong, it's much bigger than your home, the prison</p>
<p class="body">Actually, your kind of company</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying if you are in that kind of life, it's your kind of company</p>
<p class="body">Food is good, you're far fitter than most people on the outside</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to do a job to get your food</p>
<p class="body">It's actually very good, but lack of freedom kills a man totally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I want to go back to the experiencing this</p>
<p class="body">These different life forms that you experienced</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Generally, yes</p>
<p class="body">A lot of people who have been there have been talking about it, but a lot of talk is of that nature</p>
<p class="body">See as I said, I'm a super skeptic</p>
<p class="body">I don't believe anything that anybody says, nor do, nor do I disbelieve right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You have to experience it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Somebody says something</p>
<p class="body">Maybe it's true for them</p>
<p class="body">I will respect that, but it's not that I have to believe it unless it happens to me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think that a certain state of mind or being is what? </p>
<p class="body">Puts you in touch with these other life forms</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, let's see these two things you're saying in the same context, and that's how normally it's used in the society</p>
<p class="body">People think a state of mind is everything</p>
<p class="body">Right, see mind itself is a very limited process in the sense see right now</p>
<p class="body">Generally in the western world you think mind means your intellect, thought process, right? </p>
<p class="body">Your thought process cannot generate anything other than the data that you already possess</p>
<p class="body">Can you think of something that's not at all there in your data? </p>
<p class="body">Imagination, you're only your imagination is just an exaggeration of the data that you already</p>
<p class="body">Have OK</p>
<p class="body">If there is no data you cannot imagine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this thing that you experienced was beyond imagination</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll come to that OK, I see right now when you say state of mind you're talking about</p>
<p class="body">Whether you're equanimous or you're disturbed, or you're happy, unhappy, or you're, you're able to penetrate something you're not able to penetrate</p>
<p class="body">Something in terms of intellect, but all these are dependent because it is like your computer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you remove the data, it's just a blank screen</p>
<p class="body">So if I remove all the memory that you have, you're just a blank screen, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So right now your ideas of right and wrong, your ideas of your nationality, your ideas of your race, your ideas of your religion, your ideas of your family, your ideas of yourself is all in the memory bank</p>
<p class="body">If we just</p>
<p class="body">Take out that memory chip</p>
<p class="body">Nothing, nothing</p>
<p class="body">So your whole intellect is functioning from that</p>
<p class="body">Because you can see</p>
<p class="body">Because you cannot see the end of the universe</p>
<p class="body">If you could see the end of the universe, you would say it's just me here nobody else because you cannot see because you're here</p>
<p class="body">Maybe there are people there</p>
<p class="body">This is an imagination, all right</p>
<p class="body">Imagination is rooted in the data that you already have</p>
<p class="body">You cannot imagine something new</p>
<p class="body">You use 2 words together, state of mind and state of being</p>
<p class="body">Being means this</p>
<p class="body">See right now you have a body, but when you were born you were only this much</p>
<p class="body">Now you became this much how the food that you've eaten, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Now you have a mind when you were born, you were just poo poo poo poo like a little baby</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly you become all this how? </p>
<p class="body">Whole accumulation of impressions isn't it through five senses</p>
<p class="body">What you have seen what you have heard, what you've smelled, what you've tasted, what you've touched from this, you've formed a whole lot of information with which you have a mind of your own</p>
<p class="body">How rich that information is makes you look that smart in a given society</p>
<p class="body">All right, if you're well informed</p>
<p class="body">Just because you have a good data chip, people think you're smart, not necessarily</p>
<p class="body">Essentially, smart means always in comparison to somebody else</p>
<p class="body">So these days everybody</p>

<p class="body">Transcript 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Within the</p>
<p class="body">Part of Coimbatore city, there was a prison central prison, so I said let me go and see who is inside. I want to work with them. About 28 years ago</p>
<p class="body">And then I found it took me over two years to get inside</p>
<p class="body">It's so difficult to get in</p>
<p class="body">You need qualifications</p>
<p class="body">You know I was not qualified</p>
<p class="body">It took all kinds of permissions to get inside because this was a high security prison</p>
<p class="body">Then once I got in, everybody said all the prison officers who knew me</p>
<p class="body">They said Sadhguru, you're wasting your time here every Sunday</p>
<p class="body">Christian priest come all these guys do his mischief on Hindu festivals</p>
<p class="body">Hindu people come, they do more mischief and Muslims come more mischief</p>
<p class="body">Other kinds of service organizations come more mischief is all you will get</p>
<p class="body">You'll just waste your time here</p>
<p class="body">Please don't do this</p>
<p class="body">I said you just give Me 2 hours</p>
<p class="body">So there were 12 wards in the QT prison, each with about 200 prisoners. So I took the long term prisoners one ward with 200 people</p>
<p class="body">So when I went there, I said they wanted to put them in the C normally prism</p>
<p class="body">In there they pushed them into one Holland</p>
<p class="body">So sit down here</p>
<p class="body">So the guru has come</p>
<p class="body">I said no</p>
<p class="body">Just I want to meet them on the ground outside</p>
<p class="body">They are all sitting there like this</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, OK, who's this guy was coming? </p>
<p class="body">You know they have a certain</p>
<p class="body">This is an anger and angst against the society which is locked him up</p>
<p class="body">It's very difficult for people to understand what this is</p>
<p class="body">I'm not, not once I've gone into prison and come out without tears in my eyes because</p>
<p class="body">Everything seems normal</p>
<p class="body">On the surface there is pain in the air</p>
<p class="body">Just this is so important for a human being to be free you</p>
<p class="body">Know yes</p>
<p class="body">Just nothing else</p>
<p class="body">Food is good, they get food better than probably their homes</p>
<p class="body">Everything is controlled</p>
<p class="body">They're all very fit, actually much more fitter than the outside people</p>
<p class="body">But there is pain in the air</p>
<p class="body">Just it's so painful so I went there and we played a game with them</p>
<p class="body">They were just surprised that I'm playing a game with them</p>
<p class="body">We played dodgeball</p>
<p class="body">With the guys within about 10-15 minutes, they have forgot their. You know, prison like little children there screaming and yelling and playing like crazy</p>
<p class="body">And then I told them see I want to stay here for 10 days and work with you. You won't believe 80% of them in two hours time. They're all crying. They said don't go you stay with us</p>
<p class="body">And then we started the program. Since then, continuously last 27 years programs have been going on</p>
<p class="body">Most of them are, you know, school dropouts</p>
<p class="body">They're not really very literate and educated</p>
<p class="body">But they wrote thousands of poems</p>
<p class="body">One one guy who killed three people in the courtroom so he was in the courtroom</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">In the courtroom though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">He killed three people</p>
<p class="body">Some vengeance</p>
<p class="body">Issue, you know? </p>
<p class="body">So he's on the death row</p>
<p class="body">See, prison is quite a normal society during the daytime</p>
<p class="body">It's evening 6:00 o'clock</p>
<p class="body">There they have to go inside and the doors are locked</p>
<p class="body">Even if the medical emergency nobody can open those doors unless a magistrate gives permission</p>
<p class="body">The local officer cannot open the gate even if the guy is dying inside</p>
<p class="body">It cannot be opened no matter what happens</p>
<p class="body">That's the law</p>
<p class="body">So he wrote a poem which stuck in my mind</p>
<p class="body">He said every day when the cell door closed, I thought this is my grave</p>
<p class="body">But now I see it's become my Bodhi tree and the gate when the door closes, I close my eyes and I'm in a completely different space altogether</p>
<p class="body">This is my freedom</p>
<p class="body">And now after after about six years he was executed</p>
<p class="body">And we also took local industry and promised them that you know when they come out, they'll be jobs for them</p>
<p class="body">Those who can come out after a few years because in India life term is 20 years, not life life</p>
<p class="body">And in 20 years, if there's good behavior 14 years, they'll get a remission</p>
<p class="body">So many of them who have been there for murder in 14 years time they will come out so nobody gives them a job everywhere</p>
<p class="body">Everybody looks at them suspiciously</p>
<p class="body">So we set up their local businesses to include them into their factories and businesses so that they're not going to commit murder every day</p>
<p class="body">It's just happened once in their lifetime</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So how? </p>
<p class="body">How does yoga reform these people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is all it is to tell me if you're feeling very happy right now</p>
<p class="body">Will you go and beat up? </p>
<p class="body">That guy, Jamie</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let me know even if I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Was mad, even if he's somebody that you don't like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I love Jamie</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, it's not him anybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh anybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When you're joyful, will you go and simply beat up that guy? </p>
<p class="body">No something nasty happening within you</p>
<p class="body">Anger your anger, frustration, something that's when you do ugly things, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah well yeah sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is true for every human</p>
<p class="body">So you you just label somebody as a criminal</p>
<p class="body">What you need to understand is this is a deep rooted unhappiness or frustration or something that's built up because of social reasons or parental reasons or genetic reasons</p>
<p class="body">There's so many, OK, not one aspect</p>
<p class="body">Somewhere this life is unhappy</p>
<p class="body">Frustrated, angry now it wants to do something unpleasant</p>
<p class="body">If this life is feeling very pleasant, why will it do unpleasant things? </p>
<p class="body">So this is all we have focused too much in this world</p>
<p class="body">On trying to produce good human beings</p>
<p class="body">Good human beings</p>
<p class="body">Have caused terrible things</p>
<p class="body">People who think they are good</p>
<p class="body">They have done the worst possible things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's a lot of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Thinking they are good</p>
<p class="body">If we focus on creating joyful and sensible human beings</p>
<p class="body">A whole lot of trouble will</p>
<p class="body">Go away in the world</p>
<p class="body">This is what yoga is about that you're pleasant within yourself when you are feeling pleasant, you do pleasant things naturally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, so you create</p>
<p class="body">This environment where people learn to be pleasant</p>
<p class="body">Or you help them cultivate that pleasantness</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not an environment, it is you understand</p>
<p class="body">Human experience is coming from within me, see right now</p>
<p class="body">Let's say we are working together and I'm oppressive, whatever and you think you're unhappy because of me</p>
<p class="body">But if you realize, see my unhappiness is my doing</p>
<p class="body">You will undo it, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">You think your unhappiness is because of me? </p>
<p class="body">It goes on and on because</p>
<p class="body">It's under my control now</p>
<p class="body">The day you realize my unhappiness, the source of my unhappiness, unhappiness is me, not somebody else</p>
<p class="body">And you take charge of that aspect there</p>
<p class="body">Is there is a method to do that</p>
<p class="body">Once you do that, you are happy</p>
<p class="body">Once you are happy by your own nature then you will do what is most needed, because once you are very happy you have no pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">Your life is an expression of joy, not in pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">This is the shift that needs to happen in the world right now</p>
<p class="body">People are in pursuit of happiness</p>
<p class="body">If your life becomes an expression of your joy rather than being pursuit of happiness, you will Start Stop squeezing the world the way you're squeezing it</p>
<p class="body">This soil, this environment, these problems everything is</p>
<p class="body">In pursuit of human happiness and well being</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think that the physical practice of yoga, meaning the exercise aspect of it, alleviates tension and allows people to relax enough to look at their life in a different way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If they do it properly, yes</p>
<p class="body">When they, when I say properly</p>
<p class="body">Some people are trying to do it like anaerobic exercise</p>
<p class="body">No, we teach what is called as classical yoga</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to do all these very difficult postures and all that</p>
<p class="body">Most yogis master only one posture</p>
<p class="body">People don't know this in this country, only one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">One posture like what posture? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Sure, anything they will choose one posture and they will just master that</p>
<p class="body">So actually in the you know the traditionally what yoga says is if you master one posture, that means generally</p>
2 hours, 40 minutes</p>
<p class="body">If you can sit one way without any sense of discomfort, irritation, agitation, nothing in your system, this is your posture</p>
<p class="body">You just master that one posture, then the rest of the yoga is internal</p>
<p class="body">Physical body is only that much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So most yogis just have one thing that they do and they can do it for hours</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, if they can</p>
<p class="body">If you can sit here, see what it means is your body is not in the vein</p>
<p class="body">Your body, yeah see right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is not in</p>
<p class="body">The way that it's still there pudding</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You want to be happy, but your thought is in the way your emotion is in the way your body is in the way</p>
<p class="body">So once you put the body away, you must understand</p>
<p class="body">In yoga there is no such thing as mind</p>
<p class="body">There is physical body</p>
<p class="body">There is mental body</p>
<p class="body">If your body is not in the way, suddenly you discover that even your mind is not in the way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How do you think they figured this out? </p>
<p class="body">This is getting back to this you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Kind of went around that, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This this happened over 15,000 years ago. The first Yogi he's referred to as the Adiyogi today. To honor him we have set up 112 feet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Tall bust of Adi Yogi</p>
<p class="body">In India, you must look him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
112 feet tall bust what part of India? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You can look him up</p>
<p class="body">Audio guy</p>
<p class="body">In southern India, Enquanto in Tamil Nadu. So this is 112 feet because he gave 112 methods</p>
<p class="body">As to how? </p>
<p class="body">So this is what to say this is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
1000 years ago I figured</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This out over 15,000 years ago</p>
<p class="body">Bear saying this over 15,000 years ago because of they talked about certain celestial happenings. Those happenings have been confirmed today as well over 15,000 years ago and we have iconographic proof of something like 12,400 years. Yeah, that's odd</p>
112 feet tall</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Great hair</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a crazy statue, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This design this is this was designed by me and built by all volunteers inside the center, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How old is that statue? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Really so is that, uh? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Where was building? </p>
<p class="body">So can you go inside of? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is just</p>
<p class="body">That you can go inside, but there's no building inside because it's metal</p>
<p class="body">It gets very hot inside</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wow, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Beautiful. The idea was when I designed this it took Me 2 1/2 years to design this face</p>
<p class="body">You're not seeing the face very clearly</p>
<p class="body">Let's see if we can get a picture where the</p>
<p class="body">Face is clear</p>
<p class="body">It's very yeah maybe yeah</p>
<p class="body">So I wanted intoxication, stillness and exuberance on one face. So it took Me 2 1/2 years</p>
<p class="body">To design this</p>
<p class="body">Face, what do you think it has these qualities? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I think this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I think you nailed it</p>
<p class="body">How was this constructed? </p>
<p class="body">This is all metal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's all metal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How did how was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It made so we made this. It took us some 680 tons of steel</p>
<p class="body">Now we are doing another one near Bangalore, the same one. But now we are doing it with almost 170 tons less because now we figured out the design much better</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wow, wow</p>
<p class="body">That's incredible though</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it really is gorgeous, and that's all</p>
<p class="body">Is it welded together? </p>
<p class="body">Like how is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, see</p>
<p class="body">We say you can see some patchwork here</p>
<p class="body">You're not seeing it, but actually the metal pieces are all about this much size</p>
<p class="body">We could have removed that we could have, we know, braced that and removed that, but when I looked at it, the roughness of it looked better than a smooth face, so I just left it as it is</p>
<p class="body">So there are</p>
<p class="body">Patches so you can</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And the construction method when you're saying it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, you can see the construction material</p>
<p class="body">Not really that visible, but you can see for an observer you can see that which gives a kind of roughness</p>
<p class="body">To the statue</p>
<p class="body">Not very smooth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this Yogi, the device is 112</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So when he came, he appeared somewhere in Himalayas and</p>
<p class="body">People saw that he was dancing wildly in ecstatic states, completely oblivious to everything around him</p>
<p class="body">Or he sat still</p>
<p class="body">For days on end weeks on end he just sat, still unmoving</p>
<p class="body">So initially a lot of thousands of people gathered some miracle is happening, but slowly because he didn't perform any miracles, no fireworks happened, people got bored and they left</p>
<p class="body">Only seven disciples hung on because they saw the greatest miracle</p>
<p class="body">He's the man is not getting up for food, water, toilet, nothing</p>
<p class="body">That means he's beyond the physical nature</p>
<p class="body">He just sat there for months on end</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes the only sign of his aliveness was tears of ecstasy were dribbled dribbling down his cheeks</p>
<p class="body">That was the only sign of life</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise he looked like he's dead</p>
<p class="body">So when he came to his some moments when he came to his consciousness, they pleaded they wanted to learn</p>
<p class="body">What is it that is happening to you? </p>
<p class="body">So he tried to be dismissive</p>
<p class="body">He didn't want to be in touch with them, but when they hung on, when they persisted then he put them on a preparatory kind of work</p>
<p class="body">They went through the preparatory work and then he started expounding for many years</p>
<p class="body">What is the science of how human mechanism is made? </p>
<p class="body">And you won't believe this? </p>
100 and 150 years ago, Charles Darwin talked about evolutionary process</p>
<p class="body">Over 15,000 years ago he spoke something which is parallel to Darwin's theory of evolution. Even today every Indian knows about Indian person knows about this. There are 10 authors</p>
<p class="body">Avatar means not the movie that you saw</p>
<p class="body">Avatar means a manifestation</p>
<p class="body">So 10 hours, our first avatar is called Match Avatar, which means the life was in the form of fish or it was water</p>
<p class="body">It was in the</p>
<p class="body">Water, the second one is</p>
<p class="body">Gourmet author, which means it's a turtle that means it became an amphibious life</p>
<p class="body">The third one is a wild war</p>
<p class="body">It's called where hotter it you know other small things happen, but the mammals came, then the next one is called narashima who is half man half animal</p>
<p class="body">Next one is a doffed man, woman author</p>
<p class="body">The next one is a full grown man, but Awala tile man. He's so angry and so crazy over fighting man that always he went about chopping off people to he got so angry and he lopped off his own mother's head</p>
<p class="body">So the next one is a peaceful man, is, uh, Rama, author</p>
<p class="body">He's a peaceful gentleman</p>
<p class="body">The next one is a loving man</p>
<p class="body">Krishna avatar, the next one is a Buddha avatar who's a meditative man</p>
<p class="body">The next one the 10th one is supposed to be the mystical man</p>
<p class="body">These are not individual people to be seen these. This is the evolution of life on the planet. If you look at Darwin's theory of evolution somewhere, it runs parallel to this from waterborne life to amphibious life too</p>
<p class="body">This way half man half animal dwarfed man like this it is grown so he talked about this and he said see if you want to evolve further</p>
<p class="body">Then something in relationship to the Earth and the sun must change</p>
<p class="body">Otherwise, physiologically, you're not going to evolve further, but you have a consciousness with which you can transform yourself absolutely and become completely different from what you are right now</p>
<p class="body">Right now, you're available to all the forces of nature</p>
<p class="body">Right now, in many ways you are enslaved to what's happening around you</p>
<p class="body">You can rise above this and evolve consciously</p>
<p class="body">But physiological evolution has come to a standstill because planetary movement and who you are right now, the the planet and the solar system is functioning like a Potter's wheel. To make this happen</p>
<p class="body">This life, like a Potter's wheel, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Like what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Potter's wheel, Potter's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Wheel yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's functioning like that</p>
<p class="body">It's got new to this place, so people ask can we can we develop more intelligence? </p>
<p class="body">Can we become bigger than this? </p>
<p class="body">He says no</p>
<p class="body">Physiologically, your evolution has come to a place, unless there is some serious change in the relationship between the planet and the</p>
<p class="body">Son, that will not happen, but consciously you can evolve. So then he propounds 112 ways as to how you can do it. 112 distinct ways, how you can do it</p>
<p class="body">So that is how yoga started</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Who do you think this person was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">These are the Yogi</p>
<p class="body">If they called him because he never introduced himself, they called him Yogi because he was the first one</p>
<p class="body">They called him adiyogi</p>
<p class="body">Adiyogi means the first Yogi</p>
<p class="body">And he is also referred to as Shiva</p>
<p class="body">Shiva means one who is not</p>
<p class="body">That which is not in the sense see today. Modern science is speaking in these terms in an atom. For example, over 99% of it is empty space</p>
<p class="body">That is proton, neutron, electron. All that covers less than one percent, 99% is empty space, so it is in the cosmos</p>
99% is empty space. See right now you look at this ceiling and you think it's full of star like lights, but actually there's more empty space than lights, isn't it? But because our visual apparatus are in a certain</p>
<p class="body">Certain way, designed in a certain way, it gives more prominence to light because that's what we see more clearly</p>
<p class="body">So he said everything is like this</p>
<p class="body">So if you transcend your physical nature, you become a Shiva</p>
<p class="body">That means you are nothing, but nothing is the most powerful dimension of the existence because it is in the lap of the nothingness</p>
<p class="body">Everything is happening</p>
<p class="body">What you call as everything is just 1%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think this was a real person of a real individual, or do you think it's representative of the the learning of yoga and the best way to establish it to express it was to make it a person? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a real person because the places where he came, what he spoke, everything is recorded in history, largely by lore</p>
<p class="body">Today people are trying to write it down in books because in India we don't believe in scholarship</p>
<p class="body">We believe in experience in our experience, so it's always transmitted as a oral tradition for a long time</p>
<p class="body">These days people are writing down in many ways</p>
<p class="body">It was a real person because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The credit for spectacular human being</p>
<p class="body">If they could do all the things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Absolutely see when he came down South in southern India at that time, people were way shorter than the northern people</p>
<p class="body">So they say he was twice the height of an average South Indian woman</p>
<p class="body">So they say he must have been because an average South Indian woman tribal woman were like four or four and a half feet</p>
<p class="body">So he must have been seven or eight feet tall that people said he was twice that, and they say when he stood next to your horse, he was as tall as the horses ears</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But do you think these are exaggerations, do you think? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, exaggerations could be there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What do you think this is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But because his physical size doesn't mean anything for his yoga, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But why? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So there is no point exaggerating that aspect</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying right? </p>
<p class="body">So if he was a warrior, somebody may exaggerate him, but for a Yogi, what is the point making him a big? </p>
<p class="body">Guy, physically it's a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">To make him divine so so physically unique</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, that that is the whole thing, see</p>
<p class="body">In India? </p>
<p class="body">The Indian culture</p>
<p class="body">If you are on the spiritual path, we call you a seeker</p>
<p class="body">If you ascribe to religion, we call you a believer</p>
<p class="body">Alright, belief means something that you do not know because an authority speaks you believe that it could be your father who says that this is the truth and you believe in me as a child</p>
<p class="body">Then it may be a priest, then it may be somebody bigger</p>
<p class="body">Or it may be in a book you believe it because it comes from an authority, but the nature of that culture</p>
<p class="body">The eastern culture sees</p>
<p class="body">There is no authority for us</p>
<p class="body">Truth is the only authority</p>
<p class="body">Authority is never the truth, so that is the essence of Eastern mysticism and eastern spirituality</p>
<p class="body">That it is</p>
<p class="body">You're always a seeker, never a believer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you think that yoga just emanated from this one incredibly unique human being that was larger than everybody else? </p>
<p class="body">That had supernatural abilities that existed 15,000 years ago</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See now you're making a superhuman being out of somebody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But making an 8 foot tall person who can go for days on end without drinking water? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, you see there have been so there have been people like that</p>
<p class="body">Alright, in every culture there have been physically large people, but physical physical size</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there have been people that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Has nothing to do with these capabilities because the abilities</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, but the capabilities are super physical too, aren't they? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, this is what it's about</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is not about being superhuman</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is about realizing being human is super</p>
<p class="body">That's what is important, so that's the whole thing that he's saying</p>
<p class="body">How being human is so super</p>
<p class="body">If you explore your humanity to its fullest, you will become so fantastic</p>
<p class="body">Being a human being itself is a fantastic feat</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to act like a super human being</p>
<p class="body">He did not perform any miracles</p>
<p class="body">He did not do anything</p>
<p class="body">He just taught them how to be beyond the limitations of 1's physical and psychological structures. That's all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think if this person didn't exist that yoga still would have been invented without him? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Of course, somebody else would have</p>
<p class="body">After that many, many yogis have come, but he is the maybe even before there were people</p>
<p class="body">But they did not speak or they did not gather disciples who would take</p>
<p class="body">So he sent his seven disciples in seven different directions</p>
<p class="body">One was sent to southern India, who is today</p>
<p class="body">We hold him as the father of Southern mysticism</p>
<p class="body">He's August amone</p>
<p class="body">Who came down South and he did maximum amount of work there</p>
<p class="body">Every human habitation he touched at that time and brought</p>
<p class="body">Spiritual process as a living practice, not as a separate practice, just the way you say it, that just the way you do things, just the way you address each other</p>
<p class="body">Was made into a spiritual process</p>
<p class="body">See right now in India</p>
<p class="body">If people go to the temple and whatever their favorite deity</p>
<p class="body">If they worship, they will stand like this</p>
<p class="body">If anybody comes also, they'll stand like this</p>
<p class="body">If a dog comes also, they'll do this</p>
<p class="body">If they see a rock also, they'll do this</p>
<p class="body">They see a tree</p>
<p class="body">Also, they'll do this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">For the people just listening, you're holding your hands together in prayer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is not in prayer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, this way whatever you're doing with your hand</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is done to everybody</p>
<p class="body">Alright, so because spiritual process is not alien to the life that you live, the way you live has to become spiritual</p>
<p class="body">It's not that you have a spiritual practice and you</p>
<p class="body">Have a separate life</p>
<p class="body">It is the same thing you you integrate it into your life</p>
<p class="body">So he did that</p>
<p class="body">Another one stayed with him, another one came to the northern part of India</p>
<p class="body">Another one went to Central Asia</p>
<p class="body">There are, you know there are certain footprints office another when went to North Africa, another went to South Asia, another when another one came to</p>
<p class="body">South America 
<p class="body">Wherever these yogis went, suddenly those cultures where they went saw a sudden upsurge in the knowledge of geometry</p>
<p class="body">Wherever you see extraordinary sense of geometry which is not in line with the tribal existence that they had, that means a Yogi</p>
<p class="body">Same that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Sense of geometry</p>
<p class="body">Meaning like the structures that they built architecture</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, structures that they build artifacts</p>
<p class="body">They created the way they arranged things around themselves</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly they had a different sense of geometry because yoga is essentially a cosmic geometry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Cosmic geometry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">In to align yourself in line with the cosmos so that it reverberates as the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Which brings us to UFO's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">There is some substance and a lot of imagination with this UFO business</p>
<p class="body">We are always thinking life, you know, like all this I'm I'm saying this not with any</p>
<p class="body">There are many people who could have experienced something who could have seen something</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying generally the popular imagination of a UFO or craft will come on land somebody will</p>
<p class="body">Come out of it</p>
<p class="body">So you're thinking like this because that's how human beings operate alright</p>
<p class="body">That we will go land somewhere</p>
<p class="body">Then the door opens</p>
<p class="body">We come out</p>
<p class="body">How do you know that? </p>
<p class="body">Is how they also do it? </p>
<p class="body">That's not how it is</p>
<p class="body">I have living experience with certain extraterrestrial lifeforms</p>
<p class="body">You do</p>
<p class="body">There are a whole lot of videos which I've spoken about</p>
<p class="body">I have a reputation of being very logically correct now</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to lose it by talking about it to everybody, but in exclusive groups have spoken in detail</p>
<p class="body">I've made other people experience these things very profound experiences of life</p>
<p class="body">Which is not of this planet, but it's not like a craft will land</p>
<p class="body">They'll open the door, they'll come out</p>
<p class="body">This is all your own thing</p>
<p class="body">You parked the car, you opened the door, you locked the door</p>
<p class="body">You came out</p>
<p class="body">This is your thinking, alright</p>
<p class="body">It is not necessary</p>
<p class="body">Other life should operate the way we operate</p>
<p class="body">It is nothing like where we are</p>
<p class="body">It's something totally different</p>
<p class="body">So people have seen things here and there</p>
<p class="body">Some of it could be mistake</p>
<p class="body">Some of it could be exaggeration</p>
<p class="body">Some of it could be just total lies, but definitely some people have seen something some people have experienced something</p>
<p class="body">There is no denying everybody will not be lying</p>
<p class="body">There is no denying it is there</p>
<p class="body">But we are thinking just the way we are</p>
<p class="body">They will also be all we can think is a little bigger ears, little bigger eyes, maybe three eyes instead of two</p>
<p class="body">This is just exaggeration of what we already know</p>
<p class="body">Leave the imaginations aside</p>
<p class="body">Is there life beyond us? </p>
<p class="body">It would be very pompous to believe that in such a vast core cosmos, we are the only evolved life on the planet in the universe is itself a very pompous belief system</p>
<p class="body">Definitely there is more life and</p>
<p class="body">You know it is</p>
<p class="body">It is done</p>
<p class="body">We have done things with it in the past</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We've done things with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It yes, we've done some experiments with such life</p>
<p class="body">We have made people experience this very strongly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">When you say, wait who do? </p>
<p class="body">You mean we as a group? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We have done certain things you yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So how? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't go into</p>
<p class="body">It why not? </p>
<p class="body">I have a reputation of being very logically correct</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, if you're logically correct about extraterrestrials, wouldn't that be beneficial to people? </p>
<p class="body">That are hearing this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, there are</p>
<p class="body">See, our logic is related to our</p>
<p class="body">Existence the way we are made</p>
<p class="body">Yes, the way the existence is made doesn't fit into our logic</p>
<p class="body">This is the biggest mistake that modern societies are making</p>
<p class="body">You are trying to fit the existence into your logic</p>
<p class="body">No, your logic has place in the existence</p>
<p class="body">Existence cannot be</p>
<p class="body">You can't fit it into your logic</p>
<p class="body">Because your logic functions between binaries of two</p>
<p class="body">You and me have to be there for logic</p>
<p class="body">The whole spiritual experience itself is not logically correct because the experience of life is beyond two</p>
<p class="body">There are no binaries in spiritual process</p>
<p class="body">When I use the word spiritual, I'm not using the word spiritual the way religions are using</p>
<p class="body">They're talking about a spirit</p>
<p class="body">Which goes and comes and whatever not in that sense, if you experience your life</p>
<p class="body">Beyond your physiological and psychological construct</p>
<p class="body">Then your spiritual</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you mentioned it, which is already the most difficult thing to do now to talk about it</p>
<p class="body">You feel like would somehow or another discredit you</p>
<p class="body">I don't understand that because just because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I have to be logically correct, otherwise you cannot speak pleasant</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But how are you experiencing this? </p>
<p class="body">Thing can you? </p>
<p class="body">Just tell me how you're experiencing these things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See in certain spaces</p>
<p class="body">Uh, there are very strong presence, which is when you feel the texture of that life</p>
<p class="body">You know it is not like anything that we know here</p>
<p class="body">Obviously it doesn't belong here it is</p>
<p class="body">It has a different source than the life that we are</p>
<p class="body">When I say the life that we are</p>
<p class="body">See, this is the yogic sciences</p>
<p class="body">This will confuse people if we go that far because people are thinking</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is far backache</p>
<p class="body">Yoga is for health</p>
<p class="body">You guys for</p>
<p class="body">Slimming down, we've like this, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Very established, that's not the case</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So yoga means you know the texture of life</p>
<p class="body">That is one thing I'm talking about</p>
<p class="body">The texture of this life</p>
<p class="body">If you know the texture of</p>
<p class="body">This life</p>
<p class="body">OK, so people ask me how do you know all this? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know anything</p>
<p class="body">There's only one thing I know</p>
<p class="body">I know the nature of this piece of life from its origin to its ultimate because every other life is in some way built the same way</p>
<p class="body">People think I know every other life</p>
<p class="body">No, I know only this life</p>
<p class="body">But fortunately every other life from a single microbe to a human being, to every other creature</p>
<p class="body">In some ways, a reflection of this life because it's all connected</p>
<p class="body">Even the evolutionary sciences are saying the same thing</p>
<p class="body">Even the religions are saying the same thing, all right</p>
<p class="body">In that sense, I know the texture of this life and that life and every other life here, but there are some lives which don't have the texture which are totally different</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And how are you experiencing these lives? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You want me to say something ridiculous? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I don't think it's ridiculous at all, no no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, if I say something which is illogical, it will seem ridiculous, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't think it's illogical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It will be logical because it will not fit into the framework of human logic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">While the framework of human logic is based on our own experience and interpretation of the life that we lived, it doesn't mean that other people haven't experienced or interpreted something that is beyond our comprehension</p>
<p class="body">Because we haven't experienced it personally</p>
<p class="body">I think that's logical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We we have done experiments where</p>
<p class="body">We attracted certain</p>
<p class="body">Certain life which is not which doesn't have any texture of earthly life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And how do you conduct these experiments? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We I used certain people to</p>
<p class="body">Invite them into their bodies and what happened there is totally</p>
<p class="body">Unbelievable for people because I'll tell you a simple thing. I invited a certain life into one person's body</p>
<p class="body">I kept the weather was already like nearly zero</p>
<p class="body">Kind of subzero kind of atmosphere</p>
<p class="body">It was in Tibet</p>
<p class="body">And I kept a bowl of water about 3 inches above the head</p>
<p class="body">And when this life entered and I tried to hold it within that body, you won't believe this bowl which is 3 inches</p>
<p class="body">The person is lying down on the ground on wet soil</p>
<p class="body">You know they just put a bed sheet and this person is lying down</p>
<p class="body">This bowl is about 3 inches above the head on the ground</p>
<p class="body">The water started boiling</p>
<p class="body">There are over 200 people watching the water boiling, all right</p>
<p class="body">Because it created so much heat, then I let it go because it could burn up the person you know, choose out that person in some ways because the moment it felt trapped it created such heat</p>
<p class="body">The water is actually boiling 3 inches away</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did you film this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">From the bottom</p>
<p class="body">From a distance they've filmed it bad filming</p>
<p class="body">You know they were not really looking for it, but it is there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And how many times has this happened? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">We did this about two times</p>
<p class="body">We did it properly</p>
<p class="body">Another time we did a mild 1</p>
<p class="body">After that I thought I will go spend time there, which has never happened</p>
<p class="body">And above all</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't serve any purpose like that</p>
<p class="body">You know it doesn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Serve a purpose to experiment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It doesn't say it is</p>
<p class="body">It is more to</p>
<p class="body">No, not</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't serve a purpose as to how you can use because it could be</p>
<p class="body">I I have to admit I was stepping into a area where I don't know damn thing</p>
<p class="body">OK, so you could make a mistake and take somebody's life or your own life or something like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So whatever these life forms are that you're experiencing, they they're only you can only experience them through another person's body</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No no no</p>
<p class="body">Not like that only because I experienced</p>
<p class="body">I wanted to demonstrate it to the people who were</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Watching and how did you know that it was a thing? </p>
<p class="body">Like how did you know that you could experience it that way and it exhibit it? </p>
<p class="body">Put it on display for the</p>
<p class="body">People that are watching</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See your whole perception right now</p>
<p class="body">For most human being is limited to five senses</p>
<p class="body">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, this is how you know</p>
<p class="body">The world</p>
<p class="body">If something has no smell, no taste, no touch</p>
<p class="body">You won't know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But there could be an infinite number of senses that we're not aware of that we don't possess</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh yes, yes</p>
<p class="body">So these things are faced in many places, but there are certain places where there is a</p>
<p class="body">Unreasonable level of concentration</p>
<p class="body">So one place is this Kailash Mansarovar region in Tibet</p>
<p class="body">In last two years we've been not being able to go because the Chinese have closed this because of this corona virus or whatever</p>
<p class="body">Probably next year it'll open up</p>
<p class="body">Last year we went</p>
<p class="body">We viewed Colossian Manasarovar from 8 to 10 kilometres away at the Nepali border we went there and</p>
<p class="body">Even from a distance, what it does to people is unbelievable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So it's just one concentrated hotspot</p>
<p class="body">Yeah of activity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, and that too, it's like clockwork exactly 2:30 in the morning it starts</p>
<p class="body">Boom activity like that for about 1 1/2 hours. One hour 40 minutes like that. After that it just goes down</p>
<p class="body">It's almost like a busy airport boom, boom boom, boom things are happening but not like crafts or anything, just bunches of lives just up and down</p>
<p class="body">Things happening for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours Max</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think there are extraterrestrial? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think they're interdimensional? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think? </p>
<p class="body">They're spirits</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">They're not spirits, no, no</p>
<p class="body">Anything that's related to the planet</p>
<p class="body">We will just know immediately</p>
<p class="body">It's not a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Something that's from somewhere else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is definitely from somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">And you know, like</p>
<p class="body">These are crazy things, man, why do you want me to speak about this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So I don't think that that crazy</p>
<p class="body">I think they're only crazy because we haven't experienced them</p>
<p class="body">If you tried to explain</p>
<p class="body">Many of the things that we take for granted because they're normal</p>
<p class="body">To someone who's never experienced in them, like if you tried to experience fire to someone who had never experienced fire, it would be the craziest idea that you could run across them that there's a thing that's not alive</p>
<p class="body">But it consumes things and it could kill all life on this planet</p>
<p class="body">But it could also serve a purpose</p>
<p class="body">To heat your home and cook your food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is what I'm saying</p>
<p class="body">In in yoga there are three types of fires within you</p>
<p class="body">It is jitter Agni chit Agni boutigny jitter</p>
<p class="body">Agni means the fire of stomach and the reproductive aspect</p>
<p class="body">These two fires, which keep your survival going</p>
<p class="body">Chit Agni is the fire of your intelligence which propels a human being to do so many things</p>
<p class="body">Boutigny is the fire of five elements of Earth</p>
<p class="body">Earth, water, air, fire and space</p>
<p class="body">These five elements, which is the composite of what everything physical is</p>
<p class="body">So these three fires</p>
<p class="body">Only if you keep them in control right now you know, for example, we're talking about the soil</p>
<p class="body">These whole civilizations have been built because of our gastronomic fire</p>
<p class="body">And our intellectual fire</p>
<p class="body">The same gastronomic fire, if it's unquenched it can burn the world down</p>
<p class="body">Right now UN agencies</p>
<p class="body">Are predicting that by 2035 there will be dozens of civil wars across the world</p>
<p class="body">Because food shortages will cause that</p>
<p class="body">Because this fire is not met means people will set fire to</p>
<p class="body">Each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How did you know that these entities or whatever these things are that you experienced existed? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So I was talking about 5 senses</p>
<p class="body">See for your sense organs to experience anything you need a contrast</p>
<p class="body">Only because there is light you know darkness</p>
<p class="body">If it's all dark, you wouldn't know what his darkness what is like</p>
<p class="body">Only because there is night you know what's your day only because there is a woman</p>
<p class="body">You know what's a man? </p>
<p class="body">Everything is by polarities</p>
<p class="body">If there are no polarities, your eyes, your ears, your anything</p>
<p class="body">Your five senses cannot function</p>
<p class="body">So it is based on the information that these five senses has given you that your whole logical intellect has developed</p>
<p class="body">Without this information</p>
<p class="body">This will not do anything, it's only from the data that you got by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching, your intellect is functioning in a certain way, so right now you can see this part of my hand, but you can't see this part</p>
<p class="body">If you see this spot, you can't see this spot</p>
<p class="body">This is the nature of your</p>
<p class="body">Vision, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Now, if you hear that sound at that moment, you don't hear the silence</p>
<p class="body">So everything is like this</p>
<p class="body">You see only a part of it through sense perception</p>
<p class="body">Because of this, your logic is all in pieces</p>
<p class="body">So with logically if you arrive at</p>
<p class="body">Any conclusion it is like I gave you a million piece jigsaw</p>
<p class="body">You found five pieces</p>
<p class="body">You put them together and say, oh, this is a bear</p>
<p class="body">This is a bear, no, you're in Texas, this is</p>
<p class="body">A horse you said? </p>
<p class="body">Because with five pieces you arrived at some conclusion</p>
<p class="body">This is what intellect means</p>
<p class="body">This is why, in yogic sciences we don't attach any significance to what you think and feel, because out of a million piece jigsaw you found a few pieces and you're making your conclusions</p>
<p class="body">It's not of any relevance for one who wants to know it may be of relevance who one wants to survive</p>
<p class="body">It may be of relevance for one who wants to win a race with somebody else</p>
<p class="body">OK, your heart you figured out the horse better than somebody else</p>
<p class="body">You win the race, but it's not of any relevance for someone who wants to know for a seeker</p>
<p class="body">It's of no relevance</p>
<p class="body">So how to go beyond sense perception? </p>
<p class="body">How to know life beyond sense perception is the entire aspect of yoga, because as long as sense perception is on you and me distinctly separate</p>
<p class="body">No way that is you</p>
<p class="body">This is me</p>
<p class="body">Only if you go beyond sense perception</p>
<p class="body">We were doing this beyond your sensory limitations</p>
<p class="body">If you go something that not you becomes you</p>
<p class="body">Right now with food it's happening</p>
<p class="body">Something, see when it's on your plate</p>
<p class="body">You call this my food when you eat it, you say it's me, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Something that's not you became you</p>
<p class="body">So this is yoga that you understand</p>
<p class="body">The sense perception is dividing the world and this division is needed for your survival process</p>
<p class="body">But this division is no use for you to know life</p>
<p class="body">The way it is</p>
<p class="body">So the yogic sciences are focused on how to transcend the sensory perception, how to suspend your senses and simply perceive life without the division</p>
<p class="body">If you do that, everything that is here will be in some way known to you, and there is so much here that people don't see</p>
<p class="body">If you talk about it, you look like a mumbo jumbo so you know which doctor, so you don't talk about these things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But how did you know that it was going to be in that area? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It's not that I knew it's in that area</p>
<p class="body">I had heard stories about that place, but</p>
<p class="body">I thought I'll just go there one time just to see because it's a magnificent place by any standard</p>
<p class="body">It's a beautiful, beautiful place</p>
<p class="body">So it's a little over the lake is around 4400 feet above mean sea level. The Kolosh peak is almost 19,000 feet</p>
<p class="body">So once I went and the magnificent nature of that see the mountain is a place, this is</p>
<p class="body">A yogic tradition that when a Yogi gets to know certain things</p>
<p class="body">He knows he cannot share it</p>
<p class="body">His experience he cannot share it because nobody will understand it</p>
<p class="body">Because it cannot be understood, it can only be experienced</p>
<p class="body">So what he will do is he will store it in an energy form in a place where there is not too much for human footprint at the same time, it's not completely inaccessible</p>
<p class="body">There are many places like this in India</p>
<p class="body">There are places like that in other parts of</p>
<p class="body">The world also</p>
<p class="body">One fantastic place that you must visit is in United States is math opiela</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Where's that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">The number is in Wyoming, Wyoming</p>
<p class="body">Near what Rapid City? </p>
<p class="body">You they they call it the devil's tower you heard of that in many Western movies? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The devil</p>
<p class="body">Towers that from close encounters of the third kind is that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">In I don't know about that movie, but in many Western movies it's always there</p>
<p class="body">It just ends, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's close encounters of the third time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">This is called Marty Pella</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And in that Steven Spielberg movie</p>
<p class="body">That's a very significant place</p>
'cause that's where the aliens land</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, is that so</p>
<p class="body">So this is a powerful, powerful space in America</p>
<p class="body">This is 1 space I found, which is naturally tremendous, and see this is Kailash</p>
<p class="body">It's a, it is something else, it's</p>
<p class="body">It is the greatest mystical library on the planet, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Place collage</p>
<p class="body">What do you think is going on there? </p>
<p class="body">Uh, what do you think is going? </p>
<p class="body">On there, why is it all concentrated? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">It is the one thing is Adiyogi himself was there</p>
<p class="body">He lived there so he stored all that he knows there and many other yogis</p>
<p class="body">Later on, many Buddhist teachers like Padma Shamba and Manjushri</p>
<p class="body">All these people and even the Jain monks</p>
<p class="body">They all went and stored their energies there because</p>
<p class="body">The knowledge that they know they don't want it</p>
<p class="body">To be</p>
<p class="body">Lost it can't be transmitted to people because you will not find a suitable people to do that</p>
<p class="body">So you place it somewhere where in future somebody who has the capability will access this</p>
<p class="body">I'll tell you one experience</p>
<p class="body">I'm going into the mumbo jumbo world</p>
<p class="body">Why man, I came</p>
<p class="body">For the same mumbo jumbo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's not mumbled</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I came for safe soil</p>
<p class="body">You getting me somewhere else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We're doing both</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it's mumbo jumbo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, this happened</p>
<p class="body">I was, uh, this is what just thinking the years I'm not good with years</p>
<p class="body">Must be 1010 eleven years ago, maybe 2008 or</p>
<p class="body">Even before that, I'm sorry 2000</p>
<p class="body">Three or four</p>
<p class="body">I started running temperature</p>
<p class="body">I was in India no</p>
<p class="body">First I was in California</p>
<p class="body">I was in Los Angeles</p>
<p class="body">I started running temperature</p>
<p class="body">And I come to speak in the Thai group</p>
<p class="body">You know, there is an Indian group entrepreneurs group</p>
<p class="body">And I spoke there and</p>
<p class="body">The President of the Thai Group invited me to their home again to speak again to another exclusive group</p>
<p class="body">I speaking there, I'm running running very high temperature and I'm</p>
<p class="body">You know my clothes are all wet with sweat</p>
<p class="body">So one man raised his hand</p>
<p class="body">I thought he wants to ask a question</p>
<p class="body">I said fine</p>
<p class="body">He said you need to go to the emergency room right now</p>
<p class="body">I said yes, I know, but I'll finish this doc and go</p>
<p class="body">Then I finished that talk and then I went to the hospital like I was running very high temperature so they gave me this that and they said this is some kind of typhoid</p>
<p class="body">So I met one wonderful Doctor Who was a Tropical Medicine expert</p>
<p class="body">He said this is some strange kind of typhoid, so he gave me a whole lot of antibiotics</p>
<p class="body">This that I took that and then I went to UK where I had a four day residential program</p>
<p class="body">All the four days I was running very high temperature, but I finished that program in this 40 years</p>
<p class="body">I've never cancelled one program because I was not well</p>
<p class="body">I've never done that, so I went back to India. I had a television shoot I had to shoot 52 weeks of material in about four to five days</p>
<p class="body">So from whole day I'm shooting and</p>
<p class="body">If I sit down for 30-40 minutes of shoot, I'm like my whole floor. All my clothes are wet with sweat. I have to change my clothes because I'm sweating so much</p>
<p class="body">And then after shooting the whole day on the second or third day, I came home and I was like feeling like my brains are getting fried up so hot that I</p>
<p class="body">The thermometer and put it</p>
<p class="body">It said one out seven</p>
<p class="body">I thought old man, I'm killing myself right now</p>
<p class="body">So with my entire my clothes, everything I went and should have stood</p>
<p class="body">Under the cold shower</p>
<p class="body">Then I called the doctor and said, you know it was reading one or seven</p>
<p class="body">I stood under the cold shower</p>
<p class="body">So this is the smartest thing you've done in</p>
<p class="body">Your entire life</p>
<p class="body">If you had been in that for another few minutes, you would have a stroke or you would have something for sure</p>
<p class="body">Then they said it's some kind of what malaria? </p>
<p class="body">And they gave me malarial medicine. I had typhoid medicine. Then I got malaria medicine. Then they said three different types of malaria's that diagnosed in one month time and they changed the medication. Change the medication</p>
<p class="body">And then I went to Australia</p>
<p class="body">I was running temperature</p>
<p class="body">I was in Singapore</p>
<p class="body">I was running temperature</p>
<p class="body">I came to India for two days</p>
<p class="body">I was running temperature</p>
<p class="body">Then I came back to United States</p>
<p class="body">So it was my daughter's vacation, so I told her I'll take her to some lake house. Somebody had a friend of ours, so I said I'll take her on a lake</p>
<p class="body">So I have a port, you know, Ivy port running by now I have antibiotic every day running about 3:00 or 4 hours a day with Ivy port on</p>
<p class="body">I'm riding a boat and taking her around and everything going on wow</p>
<p class="body">By then I have done</p>
<p class="body">About 18 blood tests</p>
<p class="body">And about four MRI's all kinds of bizarre things. They're saying and changing the prescription and giving me this medication that medication</p>
<p class="body">Temperature didn't go down, it just went on and on</p>
<p class="body">Then I was in North Carolina on this lake house around 2:00 AM</p>
<p class="body">I knew that I was just kind of collapsing</p>
<p class="body">Gonna kind of we're not dropping off then I I I called out and they called for an ambulance</p>
<p class="body">It came and they took me to a local hospital in Cashiers, in north</p>
<p class="body">In Carolina and these doctors looked at this is they looked at all the blood tests and this is too esoteric for us</p>
<p class="body">You better go to Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">So I went to Atlanta</p>
<p class="body">There they said it's best you go to some physician in New York</p>
<p class="body">He's the best guy</p>
<p class="body">You must go there because by now, almost seven weeks I've been running continuous temperature</p>
<p class="body">I've been traveling</p>
<p class="body">All over the world</p>
<p class="body">So I went to New York and they said, you know, you must get admitted</p>
<p class="body">We'll check</p>
<p class="body">Then I got admitted by then</p>
<p class="body">I can, you know, I'm having difficulty walking</p>
<p class="body">I'm just really got like become weak</p>
<p class="body">Then, and by then my lymph nodes have swollen up so badly excruciating pain</p>
<p class="body">So they said they may have to do surgery and they have to do a biopsy first and see what is it</p>
<p class="body">Is it malignant or whatever? </p>
<p class="body">Then I'm in the hospital next day morning for the it's a general anesthesia</p>
<p class="body">They have a pre check for anesthesia</p>
<p class="body">So in that funny gown which is open on all sides, you know I'm wearing that holding like this and trying to walk holding onto the wall</p>
<p class="body">I got into the elevator to go to another floor</p>
<p class="body">In between, in one floor the lift stopped</p>
<p class="body">A Chinese man got in, so the Doctor Who was with me, introduced</p>
<p class="body">He's the one who is going to do the surgery</p>
<p class="body">For you</p>
<p class="body">Then the Chinese doctor felt the lymph nodes like this and said it's very deep</p>
<p class="body">You must inform the family</p>
<p class="body">Then I went for the test</p>
<p class="body">For the anesthetic tests, then I said I'm going home</p>
<p class="body">Doctor said no, sadhguru, this is very dangerous</p>
<p class="body">You can't leave the</p>
<p class="body">Hospital I said no, I'm going</p>
<p class="body">I said I'll go</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to go through this surgery, so I went back</p>
<p class="body">A friend had an apartment in Manhattan area</p>
<p class="body">I just closed my eyes and sat for four days</p>
<p class="body">My temperature went down, the swelling went down</p>
<p class="body">In 21 days I was in Kailash Trekt</p>
<p class="body">You know my muscle mass had gone down</p>
<p class="body">My legs had become like this</p>
<p class="body">Always I've been walking, trekking, playing games</p>
<p class="body">I've had some muscle not like you, but I have some muscle to keep me going, but my muscle must went down so much in these eight weeks I just shrank like that</p>
<p class="body">With great difficulty, difficulty, I trekked there</p>
<p class="body">I could barely speak</p>
<p class="body">And I sat there for two hours</p>
<p class="body">I took one strand of what is there on that mountain. You won't believe in 2 1/2 hours</p>
<p class="body">I was almost 10 to 15 years younger</p>
<p class="body">Than what I was at that moment</p>
<p class="body">People around me will vouch for it</p>
<p class="body">How suddenly I'm a different man? </p>
<p class="body">After eight weeks of fever and all kinds of treatments, without knowing what it is</p>
<p class="body">So that is the power of that mountain</p>
<p class="body">It's not just to heal you of your health or something</p>
<p class="body">It is tremendous amount of</p>
<p class="body">Everything that one can know in the universe is stored there in some way</p>
<p class="body">It is your ability to pull it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But you were you were covered in Manhattan, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, what makes you think it's that mountain? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, I closed my eyes and I did what I have to do with my system</p>
<p class="body">Which gave me a rest bite</p>
<p class="body">But still I was not fully there, still very weak and like that but I just</p>
<p class="body">Bounce back in 2 1/2 hours time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What is it? </p>
<p class="body">But I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't understand what it has to do with that mountain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See, this is what it is</p>
<p class="body">What you think is you is not just contained in the boundaries of this body</p>
<p class="body">If you are willing to open up that boundary</p>
<p class="body">The whole the whole existence is with you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you opened up your body after all those weeks and you don't think it has anything to do with the antibiotics you were taking or that you were finally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Antibiotics didn't give me a respite at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Getting some rest</p>
<p class="body">But you never rest</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm very restful, even if I'm traveling and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But you were constantly working right</p>
<p class="body">You were explaining all the different things you were doing and that you were constantly taxing yourself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but</p>
<p class="body">I do, but</p>
<p class="body">It's awesome</p>
<p class="body">No, I don't text myself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But that was taxing</p>
<p class="body">You were sweating through your clothes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, that's because the fever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You never rest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">But but I'm saying this swelling, which they said without looking inside</p>
<p class="body">They will do biopsy, and most probably they'll do surgery along with that</p>
<p class="body">Which was excruciating pain</p>
<p class="body">Just went down when</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But it went down after you rested, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Not rested, I sat with my eyes closed</p>
<p class="body">I didn't sleep</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I sat but you didn't do anything for four days</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you wanted to explain</p>
<p class="body">It This is why I</p>
<p class="body">Said see I'm going into mumbo jumbo land</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, I believe you</p>
<p class="body">I'm not, I'm not</p>
<p class="body">I'm not quite, I'm just trying to piece together why</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So I'm saying when doctors, every every qualified doctor says saying that I'm in a state where you will have to inform the family because I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">In life situations, life and death situation, you don't recover just because four days you sit there with eyes closed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You don't think so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, not because of rest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You think that there was something supernatural or something else? </p>
<p class="body">What is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I I never</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The term you would use</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Used the word supernatural because everything is within the aspect of nature</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, what would you use? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So which aspect of nature are you in right now? </p>
<p class="body">That is the thing, see</p>
<p class="body">One aspect of your nature is survival</p>
<p class="body">For example, for every human being because of survival, you treat to build boundaries around yourself, whether it's a national boundary or a individual boundary, your house boundary, or your personal boundaries</p>
<p class="body">These all you know self preservation boundaries, right? </p>
<p class="body">But there is also something within you which wants to expand, which doesn't lack boundaries</p>
<p class="body">Why people suffer the prison like that is just the boundaries</p>
<p class="body">Nothing else wrong, it's much bigger than your home, the prison</p>
<p class="body">Actually, your kind of company</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying if you are in that kind of life, it's your kind of company</p>
<p class="body">Food is good, you're far fitter than most people on the outside</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to do a job to get your food</p>
<p class="body">It's actually very good, but lack of freedom kills a man totally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I want to go back to the experiencing this</p>
<p class="body">These different life forms that you experienced</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Generally, yes</p>
<p class="body">A lot of people who have been there have been talking about it, but a lot of talk is of that nature</p>
<p class="body">See as I said, I'm a super skeptic</p>
<p class="body">I don't believe anything that anybody says, nor do, nor do I disbelieve right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You have to experience it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Somebody says something</p>
<p class="body">Maybe it's true for them</p>
<p class="body">I will respect that, but it's not that I have to believe it unless it happens to me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you think that a certain state of mind or being is what? </p>
<p class="body">Puts you in touch with these other life forms</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, let's see these two things you're saying in the same context, and that's how normally it's used in the society</p>
<p class="body">People think a state of mind is everything</p>
<p class="body">Right, see mind itself is a very limited process in the sense see right now</p>
<p class="body">Generally in the western world you think mind means your intellect, thought process, right? </p>
<p class="body">Your thought process cannot generate anything other than the data that you already possess</p>
<p class="body">Can you think of something that's not at all there in your data? </p>
<p class="body">Imagination, you're only your imagination is just an exaggeration of the data that you already</p>
<p class="body">Have OK</p>
<p class="body">If there is no data you cannot imagine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this thing that you experienced was beyond imagination</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll come to that OK, I see right now when you say state of mind you're talking about</p>
<p class="body">Whether you're equanimous or you're disturbed, or you're happy, unhappy, or you're, you're able to penetrate something you're not able to penetrate</p>
<p class="body">Something in terms of intellect, but all these are dependent because it is like your computer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">If you remove the data, it's just a blank screen</p>
<p class="body">So if I remove all the memory that you have, you're just a blank screen, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So right now your ideas of right and wrong, your ideas of your nationality, your ideas of your race, your ideas of your religion, your ideas of your family, your ideas of yourself is all in the memory bank</p>
<p class="body">If we just</p>
<p class="body">Take out that memory chip</p>
<p class="body">Nothing, nothing</p>
<p class="body">So your whole intellect is functioning from that</p>
<p class="body">Because you can see</p>
<p class="body">Because you cannot see the end of the universe</p>
<p class="body">If you could see the end of the universe, you would say it's just me here nobody else because you cannot see because you're here</p>
<p class="body">Maybe there are people there</p>
<p class="body">This is an imagination, all right</p>
<p class="body">Imagination is rooted in the data that you already have</p>
<p class="body">You cannot imagine something new</p>
<p class="body">You use 2 words together, state of mind and state of being</p>
<p class="body">Being means this</p>
<p class="body">See right now you have a body, but when you were born you were only this much</p>
<p class="body">Now you became this much how the food that you've eaten, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Now you have a mind when you were born, you were just poo poo poo poo like a little baby</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly you become all this how? </p>
<p class="body">Whole accumulation of impressions isn't it through five senses</p>
<p class="body">What you have seen what you have heard, what you've smelled, what you've tasted, what you've touched from this, you've formed a whole lot of information with which you have a mind of your own</p>
<p class="body">How rich that information is makes you look that smart in a given society</p>
<p class="body">All right, if you're well informed</p>
<p class="body">Just because you have a good data chip, people think you're smart, not necessarily</p>
<p class="body">Essentially, smart means always in comparison to somebody else</p>
<p class="body">So these days everybody</p>
<p class="body">Being means this</p>
<p class="body">See right now you have a body, but when you were born you were only this much</p>
<p class="body">Now you became this much how the food that you've eaten, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Now you have a mind when you were born, you were just poo poo poo like a little baby</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly you become all this how? </p>
<p class="body">Whole accumulation of impressions isn't it through five senses</p>
<p class="body">What you have seen what you have heard, what you've smelled, what you've tasted, what you've touched from this, you have formed a whole lot of information with which you have a mind of your own</p>
<p class="body">How rich that information is makes you look that smart in a given society</p>
<p class="body">All right, if you're well informed</p>
<p class="body">Just because you have a good data chip, people think you are smart, not necessarily</p>
<p class="body">Essentially, smart means always in comparison to somebody</p>
<p class="body">Else so these days everybody saying they have a smartphone</p>
<p class="body">See, when would you call somebody smart? </p>
<p class="body">Only if they're smarter than you? </p>
<p class="body">So if you say smartphone, obviously it is smarter than you simply because it has more memory than you</p>
<p class="body">Isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">And it has more multiple functionality than you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">More access to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Information yes, so</p>
<p class="body">That is intellect, but intellect is not everything</p>
<p class="body">When it comes to intellect, would you like your intellect sharp or blunt? </p>
<p class="body">Tell me I'm going to bless you right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You're gonna bless me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you want it sharp or? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Blunt, I'm gonna go with sharp sounds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So that means your intellect is a cutting instrument</p>
<p class="body">It's like a knife</p>
<p class="body">The more sharper it is, the better it is</p>
<p class="body">The sharp knife you can dissect and know things so I want to know Joe Rogan right now, shall I dissect him? </p>
<p class="body">Will I know him if I open him up? </p>
<p class="body">Will I know him? </p>
<p class="body">That way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, you're gonna have to experience</p>
<p class="body">No, you're gonna have to experience</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, that's it so</p>
<p class="body">Dissection may show me the how your heart is, how your liver is, how your kidney is, but you won't meet Joe out there all right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So by dissection you can know physical things by dissection</p>
<p class="body">You cannot know anything which is beyond that all right</p>
<p class="body">The life in you cannot be perceived by dissection of any kind</p>
<p class="body">So now with an intellect which is a knife with this knife, if you try to</p>
<p class="body">Stitch your clothes</p>
<p class="body">Then you will be like today's fashion</p>
<p class="body">Everybody is in tatters</p>
<p class="body">So to stitch you need a different kind of tool to cut, you need a different kind of tool right now with a cutting tool</p>
<p class="body">People are trying to do everything</p>
<p class="body">You know, this happened to me at that time</p>
<p class="body">I was crisscrossing India on my motorcycle when I was just in my early 20s</p>
<p class="body">And whole night I've been riding early morning I come into a small place where there is a streetside tea shop where</p>
<p class="body">I had sat down and had a tea and those days this motorcycle chain, you know if you ride 16 hundred 700 kilometers really fast, it becomes slack. You have to remove one link</p>
<p class="body">Today modern motorcycles have made differently. It's very different those days, like around 708 hundred kilometres means it'll become slack so almost every day I have to remove one link from the chain and I have a spare chain with me always because it'll go off on a inner day. At those days I'm riding 1000 to 1200 kilometers per day</p>
<p class="body">In those days when roads were not great and our motorcycle was just 250CC single stroke engine all right. I'm sorry 2 stroke engine so</p>
<p class="body">I was having my tea</p>
<p class="body">It's not very difficult to fix the chain, but it's messy</p>
<p class="body">Your hands get dirty, you need soap and everything</p>
<p class="body">I was having tea and I saw the opposite</p>
<p class="body">There was a small shack</p>
<p class="body">He had moubarak mechanical works</p>
<p class="body">He had written</p>
<p class="body">Strapping young youth I told him, hey, come here man can you fix my chain is that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh yes Sir, I can fix it</p>
<p class="body">I said OK</p>
<p class="body">Then he came out with a chisel and hammer</p>
<p class="body">I said wait? </p>
<p class="body">And I got up and went and I looked into his shack</p>
<p class="body">He doesn't have any other tools, only thing he has is chisel and hammer</p>
<p class="body">He can fix it, but after that nobody can fix anything on that motorcycle</p>
<p class="body">So right now most human beings are like this</p>
<p class="body">They are trying to fix everything with their intellect which is a cutting instrument with a cutting instrument</p>
<p class="body">If you try to fix everything, all that you will have is a bruised life</p>
<p class="body">That's what they're having</p>
<p class="body">If there are failures in their life, they're suffering</p>
<p class="body">If they're successful, they're dying of tension</p>
<p class="body">If they're poor, they're suffering their poverty</p>
<p class="body">If they become rich, they suffer their taxes</p>
<p class="body">If they're not married, they suffer that if they're married, oh, don't tell me all the things that they do everything because you're trying to handle everything with a cutting instrument</p>
<p class="body">Naturally, you're fully bruised and bleeding by the time you're done with life</p>
<p class="body">So the perception of life is beyond intellect</p>
<p class="body">Intellect is not perception</p>
<p class="body">Intellect is coming out with permutations and combinations of information that you already possess</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So you experiencing whatever this life form was, is beyond words</p>
<p class="body">Because it's beyond anything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">See because words are a product of our intellect</p>
<p class="body">Language is a product of our intellect</p>
<p class="body">That's why I said if I speak, I'll end up speaking illogically</p>
<p class="body">Yes, because intellectually, you cannot think illogically</p>
<p class="body">If you think you can only think logically, somebody may not agree with your logic, but you can only think logically within yourself, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Nobody thinks illogically</p>
<p class="body">You may think the other guy is illogical, but he thinks you're illogical</p>
<p class="body">But within your mind, you're never illogical, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Because the thought process is like that</p>
<p class="body">That is the nature of the intellect</p>
<p class="body">You have to add 2 plus</p>
<p class="body">Two is 4</p>
<p class="body">Maybe you added 2 + 2 is 5, you got it wrong, but you're still thinking is logically correct, isn't it right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So this experience that you had</p>
<p class="body">Whatever it is, we don't have the tools</p>
<p class="body">To express it in a way that a person who hasn't experienced this can understand it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">You have you have</p>
<p class="body">The equipment you have not even opened the wraps</p>
<p class="body">Everybody has it</p>
<p class="body">There's nobody who doesn't have it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you have to experience it to know what this equipment is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">No, it's just that</p>
<p class="body">Where people are invested</p>
<p class="body">That's what they know, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">So that's all it is</p>
<p class="body">They're invested largely most people are invested in trying to be better than somebody else</p>
<p class="body">Because right from their kindergarten school, their parents, their teachers, everybody told you you must be number</p>
<p class="body">One that means you always enjoy other people's failures</p>
<p class="body">When you enjoy other people's failures, I don't call this joy. I call this sickness</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That is a sickness, and that's a sickness that a lot of people possess</p>
<p class="body">They enjoying other people failure sickness, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">He will not be</p>
<p class="body">You'll be very unhappy with your billion dollars</p>
<p class="body">Because in comparison</p>
<p class="body">See right now you are 6 feet tall</p>
<p class="body">You're not</p>
<p class="body">I'm just telling you for some time</p>
<p class="body">Let's assume you're 6 feet tall</p>
<p class="body">Now you stand like a tall man</p>
<p class="body">You walk like a tall man</p>
<p class="body">You feel like a tall man</p>
<p class="body">You think like a tall man</p>
<p class="body">You into another society where everybody is 8 feet tall</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly you walk like a short man</p>
<p class="body">Think like a short man feel like a short man so your entire perception is always in comparison</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">You could write</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">When it comes to sense organs, this is what yoga is about going beyond the senses, because this thing that you perceive in comparison is only useful for survival process</p>
<p class="body">It is not good enough to know the nature of the universe</p>
<p class="body">These are all only</p>
<p class="body">These are all realms which only interest people who just want to know</p>
<p class="body">There may be no use</p>
<p class="body">But you want to know so there is that aspect in every human being, whether it you have kept it alive or you kept it buried is a question</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's that old quote comparison is the thief of joy, I think</p>
<p class="body">Is that thorough</p>
<p class="body">Is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I remember</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, that's right</p>
<p class="body">I thought maybe Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p class="body">Originally attributed to</p>
<p class="body">Get our Roosevelt Roosevelt</p>
<p class="body">Listen man, I really enjoyed talking to you</p>
<p class="body">Thank you very much for being</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Here, yeah, thank you for having me, but, uh</p>
<p class="body">Uh, you know this soil is a serious situation, and from March 21st I'm riding 30,000 kilometres. I know I'm 65. What I see is in the last two years I've been talking to so many people, influencers, scientists, politicians, leaders. Everybody knows there's a serious problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's a serious situation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">And everybody knows what is the solution also generally</p>
<p class="body">But I think everybody was waiting for some idiot to come and bell the cat</p>
<p class="body">So here I am OK</p>
<p class="body">So next 100 days from March 21st, 100 days, we want the whole world to talk about soil because I'm addressing the COP 15 where 170 nation representatives are there where we are presenting these documents. Before that we want to raise 3 to 4 billion people to talk about soil</p>
<p class="body">Once 60% of the electorate has spoken in the world, that soil is a deep concern to them. Believe me, every government will get active on the job</p>
<p class="body">Because in a democracy the only currency is numbers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Where can someone follow this online? </p>
<p class="body">Do you have a? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Website yessavesoil.org is there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Savesoil.org 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, there's an Instagram and Twitter and Facebook</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you have an Instagram as well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">So yes, we have what is called as you can become an earth buddy if you become an earth buddy</p>
<p class="body">Every day you spend 5 to 10 minutes to enhance the message to reach as many people as possible</p>
<p class="body">So people must understand this</p>
<p class="body">People are everywhere I go</p>
<p class="body">People, sadhguru, the social media is stressing me</p>
<p class="body">This is rubbish</p>
<p class="body">See many many great beings have come in this world, but when they spoke hardly 10 people could hear them</p>
<p class="body">This is the first time you can sit here and talk to the entire world when you have such tools in your hands</p>
<p class="body">If you do not transform humanity if you do not do what is absolutely needed for this generation, it shows that we don't care enough</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to be that one who didn't care enough to do something which matters because</p>
<p class="body">Right now we are consuming the soil and food that belongs to an unborn child</p>
<p class="body">This is a crime against humanity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I hear you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Sadhguru  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's make it happen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's make it happen, I will</p>
<p class="body">I will help elevate your signal and thank you very much</p>
<p class="body">I really, really enjoyed this</p>
<p class="body">You gave me a lot to think about</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm gonna</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to continue to think about those</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Thank you, thank you</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
