<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">And and then, like with, not the English language, that's every one</p>
<p class="body">Of them, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's the most versatile too. As far as like it could either be hateful, coming out of a white person's mouth or ignorant, or it could be for a black person to be a punchline</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I guess my verb</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The greatest slur in history, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's something like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">There's like a cotton picking needed</p>
<p class="body">That's what they call American neighbors</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">You know about that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Was all about that vaccine and misinformation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In his defense, that was before he, he did his thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Before well, he should have doubled back for diggers</p>
**** that</p>
<p class="body">Only thing all mad at you joke man you ******** with India</p>
<p class="body">Arie man you had a lot of beaches that couldn't put their Shea butter on</p>
<p class="body">She pulled that bucket off Spotify</p>
<p class="body">You ******** Shea butter</p>
<p class="body">For neighbors with</p>
<p class="body">India Arie man shut out the India Arie</p>
<p class="body">Please put your music back up we</p>
<p class="body">Love you baby girl I love her too</p>
<p class="body">Mean is</p>
<p class="body">I love her voice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you know what? </p>
<p class="body">I also support what she's saying</p>
<p class="body">One of the things that she's saying is that why does why doesn't she get paid? </p>
<p class="body">Well for streams? </p>
<p class="body">It's a</p>
<p class="body">It's a predatory business</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">It is, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Maybe the the music business</p>
<p class="body">The way the record companies own the artists and you could speak to this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm out of this **** I'm about to</p>
<p class="body">Do a podcast now are you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">And flip this wraps</p>
<p class="body">It didn't move</p>
<p class="body">Podcasts it make way more</p>
<p class="body">Money than the ************* price of the ************ stream</p>
<p class="body">Moving some wraps it, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Wait a minute, wait, hold, let's go back to any</p>
<p class="body">Diary hold the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But no, so she she's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Thing is like on your scandal so she could push her own her own agenda</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I mean she was, I think</p>
<p class="body">She was genuinely upset</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">She she had a right to be upset</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But I but I</p>
<p class="body">Yes, but I I also think that she uses an opportunity to</p>
<p class="body">Express her plight, you know, express herself about her plight because artists that don't own their music</p>
<p class="body">Someone else got your music before and a lot of them it was before streaming even existed, right? </p>
<p class="body">So they had these contracts where they thought they were selling records</p>
<p class="body">You'd sell records for a certain amount of time and then someone else would own the right to the music</p>
<p class="body">But that's fine</p>
<p class="body">You already sold the records you got, your piece or whatever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Maybe it's a predatory businessman artists, don't you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">If you don't know the equation, you know you ain't gonna, you know you're not going to succeed</p>
<p class="body">You know people</p>
<p class="body">Most artists don't know that your rate, your rate of debt</p>
<p class="body">It versus your, you know rate of recruitment, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know what? </p>
<p class="body">I mean so yeah, so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In terms of like how much money they spend promoting you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, they, I mean you know if a label give you $1,000,000</p>
<p class="body">You know, I'm saying you're only gonna recoup that at like, you know, say if your percentage person is like 20%</p>
<p class="body">You only recoup</p>
<p class="body">That at the 20% rate, right, you know</p>
<p class="body">What I'm saying and</p>
<p class="body">Then you know you just sounds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like it sounds like music, musical slavery</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">And then once and then once you recoup that at that 20% rate. So how long would it take you to recoup $1,000,000 at a 20% rate? And then if we recoup that? </p>
<p class="body">Once you know I'm saying you start gaining at a 20% rate</p>
<p class="body">So it's like you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, Courtney Love broke it down in an article once she wrote an article explaining how how they do their mathematics, like how they do their accounting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">The math the music is ******** the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Crazy thing is that they kept it going even after streaming came along because the record sales were gone and now the way they do it they have a piece they make these deals with an artist where they have the piece of your merchandise</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They have a piece of your live like the live yes, the live used to be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All the artists</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
360 oh 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but now they get a piece of everything because they had to 'cause they don't sell records anymore, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so they have the streaming</p>
<p class="body">They have a little piece of this</p>
<p class="body">A little piece of that</p>
<p class="body">They got a piece of everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Most most artists, yeah, not free to use</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, you're popular enough that you can escape</p>
<p class="body">There's like a thing called escape velocity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">This looks small ******* 
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">It's my most popular to me this</p>
<p class="body">Well, that's ****** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, they got stuck in a contract though, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah so</p>
<p class="body">Yeah it is what it is, you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean it</p>
<p class="body">It just depends on what level of this game you want to be</p>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, if you you know I, I really didn't give a **** about</p>
<p class="body">Being super famous as a ************* rapper man I I wanted to turn a profit</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean in a, you know use this to, you know, put me in positions to do other things as well</p>
<p class="body">You know 'cause I'm you know definitely</p>
<p class="body">More versatile than just a rapper, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, you have the most important thing for podcasts</p>

<p class="body">He married her yo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Alright, so we are we cancelling</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">A tabloid sensation at the time tarnished Lewis reputation and did some damage to his career so in 1958, in some parts of the country you could still marry a 13 year old. That's what we're learning like, that's how crazy the world has changed in the short amount of time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Some damage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Damn yeah that's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That since 1958, nineteen 58, he thought it was totally normal to Merida 13 year old while he</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Was famous, I think in some of these states like the legal age of consent</p>
<p class="body">Still like teen **** Listen some country monkey bread</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Next **** going on in this ************ 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's take a guess</p>
<p class="body">Let's take a guess</p>
<p class="body">What do you think the youngest age of consent in this country is? </p>
<p class="body">Let's just take a guess</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
14 I think it meant some states 6 foot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I bet it's different for</p>
<p class="body">I bet it's different for boys</p>
<p class="body">Well, I bet</p>
<p class="body">I bet there's an age consent for boys that's younger than that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I think there is look up the age of consent for boys in New Mexico for having sex</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Interesting, why is that? </p>
**** uh-huh 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You're saying, uh, OK to have sex</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, you have consensual</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Sex think there was some wacky laws that they made back in the day, and it could have been something to do with famous important people that had something to do with the ******* kids</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Why is that a thing? </p>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<p class="body">I mean it, it is a thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, it it is a thing like it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's a terrible taboo that everyone scared is real</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't know what's real</p>
<p class="body">It says it's legal for an adult someone 18 or it's illegal for someone 18 year old to have sex with a minor</p>
<p class="body">Someone younger than 16</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">So 16</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, so 16 is the age</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I hit it on the head</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It wasn't 13</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did it used to be younger? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">There's something here where it says like yeah 13 to 16, but depending on how much older the the other person was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Anybody OK, anyone between the age of 13 and 16 can consent with the sex with a person who is no more than four years their senior, but that's kind of normal</p>
<p class="body">I mean like high</p>
<p class="body">School yeah well 16 to 20 is a little weird but like 13 to</p>
<p class="body">Seven weird too</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You might have grew up in New Haven, CT</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, maybe parents and education we</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">New Haven</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is a little sketchy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, that's the first time I came out here talking about</p>
<p class="body">It's all about education</p>
<p class="body">Just feed him a book</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, it's also about the culture you're growing up in, you know, and how safe you are, how safe you are to even explore ideas</p>
<p class="body">You might just be trying to survive</p>
<p class="body">You're living in the Appalachia and your ******* parents are on pills and they punch you every time</p>
<p class="body">You try to eat food</p>
<p class="body">I mean, what the **** That's a little kid out there</p>

<p class="body">That's probably having</p>
<p class="body">He's probably having that experience right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It could be a cultural thing if you're really getting into it though, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because not every</p>
<p class="body">Faction of people are like that, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like we're talking about people in inner city, like gang culture</p>
<p class="body">That's a</p>
<p class="body">That's a culture of you, know, gang violence</p>
<p class="body">Like they're growing up in that right? </p>
<p class="body">But if you look at, let's say, maybe a Jewish neighborhood right, they're not punching their kids</p>
<p class="body">You know, I mean losing the teeth, doing the drugs, kind of a thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They don't have a bunch of gangs running around</p>
<p class="body">Kind of a thing</p>
<p class="body">Italian neighborhoods, right? </p>
<p class="body">You don't really see all that kind of stuff, so I'm saying</p>
<p class="body">It really does take a village, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Thing got no game</p>
<p class="body">They get them off the mafia</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They are they running around, killing you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They used to</p>
<p class="body">Be the FBI kind of obliterated them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">So that that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Helped the community more</p>
<p class="body">I mean, why? </p>
<p class="body">Why isn't helping us? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a good point</p>
<p class="body">That's a good point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, one of the things I always say it's like if you want to make America great again, or you want to make America better, you have to have less losers</p>
<p class="body">What's the way to have less losers give people a chance to succeed so you look at the people of the worst chances of succeeding</p>
<p class="body">It's people that grow up in crime infested, drug infested, gang infested neighborhoods, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because everywhere around you</p>
<p class="body">There's terrible examples, and mostly what people do is we imitate our atmosphere, right? </p>
<p class="body">And when your your atmosphere is filled with terrible examples of crime drugs</p>
<p class="body">Gang violence, all kinds of violence</p>
<p class="body">It's casual, casual murder</p>
<p class="body">You know, that's that's people in parts of this country</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">But that comes from like that comes lack</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The fact yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Of opportunity though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It does</p>
<p class="body">It also comes from lack of attention</p>
<p class="body">Like if you looked at the United States as an Organism, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah or? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you said, Oh well, the Organism has these spots that are sick</p>
<p class="body">Very, very obvious spots</p>
<p class="body">You know, Southside Chicago</p>
<p class="body">Detroit look at these spots that are, you know, some of them you understand</p>
<p class="body">How did this happen? </p>
<p class="body">Oh Detroit, they took the ******* car manufacturing business and they moved it to another place and these people didn't have jobs and they were ****** and they were stuck there and they didn't have enough money to leave</p>
<p class="body">They just shut everything down so you get rampant part you could buy</p>
<p class="body">A house in</p>
<p class="body">Detroit for like $1000. It's crazy that isn't Gary</p>
<p class="body">Not ************ he's like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Right right, same thing Gary with the steel industry, right? </p>
<p class="body">And then I just looked at some stuff the other day</p>
<p class="body">It was like it's like the steel industry shrunk and like now and it's shrinking even more now. It's like 43% of the steel you know last year was imported so it's just like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>

<p class="body">Yeah, look at this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The Chinese delegation or whatever, right? </p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, the president</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I think the amount</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">United States, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, the amount of attention that you get when you're working that job is probably off the charts</p>
<p class="body">You probably can't sleep like everyone. Look at Obama's hair went Gray almost immediately, you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, Trump and would never be the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">I'm saying Trump Trump didn't age at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He skated through it, taking cold medicine</p>
<p class="body">He was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">He was just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Taking Adderall and riding the wave</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, was living in the White House, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Chopper if I had to guess, I think Trump is one of those dudes where he he doesn't do drugs unless the doctor prescribes it</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Like there's a part of our like our parents era where like I don't do drugs</p>
<p class="body">Meanwhile, they're on Xanax like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right so yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Hey, what the **** are you? </p>
<p class="body">Talking about, you're on a crazy drug, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Vikingen yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a crazy drug, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Prescribing their kids. Adderall yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you're drinking? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">You're drinking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And you do Xanax, you tell me you don't do drugs</p>
<p class="body">How convenient popping percs and you're mad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, right, we're the only ones</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, when when I'm high I'm so friendly I wanna hug everybody</p>
<p class="body">I'm never angry when I'm not never, I just want camaraderie and friendship and love and that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You never</p>
<p class="body">Yeah exactly don't care about that **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">An illegal drug</p>
<p class="body">Right and the ******* people that are drinking and and popping Xanax</p>
<p class="body">They're upset at you, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">We brings us together</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Definitely does, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But there's a lot of things that we'd also highlights that make you super uncomfortable</p>
<p class="body">You know people get high and they get paranoid as **** but I think it's because you should be this ******* war going on right now</p>
<p class="body">There's a crazy war going on right now in Russia, and I know excuse me in Ukraine I I've been</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I spent the last day and a half watching videos on it trying to figure out what the **** is going on and it's complicated</p>
<p class="body">It's really complicated, but what it seems is that</p>
<p class="body">Russia is worried that Ukraine has massive reserves of oil and gas, and so Russia took over, Crimea and Crimea</p>
<p class="body">It denies them access to a lot of their coastline</p>
<p class="body">When Russia did that</p>
<p class="body">And then come Ukraine was</p>
<p class="body">Apparently they were trying to, or at least in talks to join NATO</p>
<p class="body">I'm sorry if I ******* eat this up</p>
'cause I'm just remembering when I read and when</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Appalachian coming out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I watched it</p>
<p class="body">Come with us, but what they're essentially saying is that</p>
<p class="body">Crimea and and Ukraine like they they want that for the natural resources and also 'cause if that was NATO owned</p>
<p class="body">If they're a part of NATO rather then they could park missiles in Ukraine and pointed towards Russia</p>
<p class="body">It's it's wild **** because they used to all be in the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what I was reading</p>
<p class="body">Basically it was like, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Country not that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, well yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Long ago they were all part</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">NATO and Russia obviously don't get along, so it's like, yeah, if there's a sovereign nation being like, hey like flirting with NATO</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Of the Soviet Union</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They're like no I don't want</p>
<p class="body">Your military bases here like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's well, it's obviously horrific</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's going to create World War Three</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's obviously horrific, I'm not</p>
<p class="body">I'm not in any way saying that I'm on, you know, the side of the Russians in any way</p>
<p class="body">I'm not</p>
<p class="body">I'm definitely not</p>
<p class="body">But what I'm saying is like this</p>
<p class="body">This is what's going on</p>
<p class="body">It's like, uh, I'm just trying to relay the information as I know it as what the conflict is</p>
<p class="body">Without a judgment</p>
<p class="body">I'm not making any judgment</p>
<p class="body">I see all these people making these judgments on</p>
<p class="body">Whether or not this is a good war, a bad war and I'm like man, how much do we know how much, how much? </p>
<p class="body">How much time has anybody spent studying Ukraine Russian? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">No such thing as good war</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Within no such things no such thing right when you got missiles, they're firing into apartment buildings like there's no way those are the good guys</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Like that's that's the oxygen that's crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">When you you shoot a missile in a ******* apartment building like what the **** is happening, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You don't if you're not valuing life</p>
<p class="body">You can't be a good person should the US do it. All the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Time this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And that's the point, Joe. This is what I was gonna get to somebody. Put a chart up which is wild of all of the airstrikes had happened over the last like 48 hours</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Is a but just yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Dogs Obama dog</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They're constantly going on these airstrikes and that's the wild thing is the drone move</p>
<p class="body">The drone move is like you can</p>
<p class="body">Be in war and you're not even</p>
<p class="body">Really there</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like you don't even have to have a reason to enter a country and you could launch missiles from robots and you could be in Nevada bro with an Xbox controller</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Controlling it just murdering people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If you, if you're smart, you you've played video games against someone who really knows how to use one of those ******* controllers</p>
<p class="body">If you had a guy and he really knew his **** wouldn't you recruit him to work for the ******* 
<p class="body">Army yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But also been saying about like Peeping Toms get you a drone bro</p>
<p class="body">Stay in your mom's basement. You know what I mean? Like don't go in the trees in the bushes? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Don't go giving him any ideas, but for real if they can make a drone that would respond the same way an Xbox controller respond, who was gonna beat Americans? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I bet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Have robot wars</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">We have the best</p>
<p class="body">Exactly who **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But actually, who's who's the best at like Xbox? </p>
<p class="body">Is there a one country Jamie you would know this? </p>
<p class="body">Is there one country that dominates at like Call of Duty? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I think it's what is it Korea? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, they they dominate a lot of video games</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The one one of the sides there</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, well like it's like those E leagues right I think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Korea dominates Italy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Those kids kill</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They felt stadiums over there, you know stadiums</p>
<p class="body">That's crazy with people playing video games like they did it with star craft and uh</p>
<p class="body">Which country ticks the most aspects of video games? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but</p>
<p class="body">I would say the game, yeah</p>
<p class="body">I'm in Call of Duty</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, let's go</p>
<p class="body">Call of Duty</p>
'cause that's the most</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">It's mostly American based game, but like they're playing it in every country and there's people that cheat in every country, so you couldn't cheat when you're doing drone strikes and stuff so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Of course you could, that's the</p>
<p class="body">Thing you told me you wanted</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, that would be perfect</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">She throws strikes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean you could, but that the whole that's not cheating</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">You would do a drone strike in their ship</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">That's just drone striking</p>
<p class="body">That's not cheating</p>
<p class="body">That's just using all advantages</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's just tell him, tell</p>
<p class="body">Him to the war in</p>
<p class="body">The metaverse you know what I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The thing is, if you can get a person to do it, there are dudes that are so *** **** good with those controllers they play so many video games</p>
<p class="body">All they would have to do is make a video game sort of interface where the guy is watching the drone</p>
<p class="body">The drone looks like it's in a video game and he would never miss hell no</p>
<p class="body">Just be lighting people</p>
<p class="body">Up are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They already got this **** What that's the ****** talking about</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure they'll be doing</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean we have propaganda for then we have like ads about like you know, doing the army</p>
<p class="body">You can do this kind of a thing, play video games and kill people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The more I pay attention, the more I think these UFO sightings</p>
<p class="body">A lot of these UFO sightings are military aircraft they're developing</p>
<p class="body">The more I think about it, the more I think about how willing they are to talk about it</p>
<p class="body">They're they're willing to talk about the fact that</p>
<p class="body">You know that there are these ships that they can't track, and they're moving at insane rates of speed</p>
<p class="body">They're willing to talk about it</p>
<p class="body">It's like one or two things</p>
<p class="body">Either it's aliens or they've developed some kind of crazy technology, some antigravitational technology</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I think it could</p>
<p class="body">Aliens be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But it might not be</p>
<p class="body">That's the thing it's like we we can develop a lot of **** We can develop nuclear power</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">What guys have so much defense ship? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We can develop we</p>
<p class="body">We can develop nuclear missiles, hypersonic jets, jets that go fast in the speed of sound spaceships</p>
<p class="body">We could develop a lot of **** if they could just figure out a way to develop something that distorts gravity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I think that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You know 'cause this has always been the thought of it</p>
<p class="body">Like a thing that can distort gravity can act instead of like uh, like Bob Lazar talked about this when he talked about back engineering UFO's instead of like blowing fire out of the back of a rocket. There's something that just distorts gravity can go to a place almost instantaneously</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yo we need that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They're gonna figure that out, man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah 'cause is it? </p>
<p class="body">Airplanes air travel is weak right now</p>
<p class="body">Give me that **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It'll be instantaneous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">What's up with the defense of humans versus humans, though? </p>
<p class="body">I mean like, I know it's human nature, but maybe it's an earthling thing even but we spend so much money and so much brainpower on, just like defending each other from each other</p>
<p class="body">I mean, what's the point? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, well, not but very rarely individually</p>
<p class="body">The thing is, it's almost all in groups</p>
<p class="body">We're ****** because our heritage all of our ancestors came from these small groups of people that huddled up together to stay alive and everybody outside of our group was the enemy</p>
<p class="body">So we all have this programming that sucks</p>
<p class="body">And this programming is based on ancient history</p>
<p class="body">It based on the time where there's no Internet</p>
<p class="body">There was no international travel, there was no everywhere you went</p>
<p class="body">If a boat showed up on your your shore, those were murderers. That was like 8/8 times out of 10</p>
<p class="body">You know they would let you know they had a flag with a skull on it bro</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Specially in West Africa</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They had a flag with a ******* skull on it</p>
<p class="body">All over north</p>
<p class="body">America this Captain Cook's, they you know all that **** those bad ************* they they were, they were</p>
<p class="body">They would show up if someone showed up</p>
<p class="body">If it was like Christopher Columbus, if he showed up</p>
<p class="body">If you knew what the **** was going to happen, you would have grabbed everybody and ran for the hills</p>
<p class="body">You would have never stayed near those crazy ***** First of all, the diseases</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Second of all, the brutality</p>
<p class="body">I was reading this thing about Columbus where they were talking about Columbus, Hacked Off people's arms like not him himself, but his people like this</p>
<p class="body">There was a preacher that came with them and they would tell these people 'cause the people brought them gold as gifts and they said you got to bring back your weight in gold and when they didn't they would just hack off one of their arms and send them back out there to get gold</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's crazy the see if you can find that there's a priest wrote about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It in his journal it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's our American hero, Christopher Columbus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The whole team of them were sociopaths and murderers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">But he did</p>
<p class="body">He did that to the Native American</p>
<p class="body">You ***** ** **** Chris look</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And then, but that's that's the that's the most brutal, but not even the worst of it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Something like a cartel basically</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The worst of</p>
<p class="body">It was the</p>
<p class="body">Diseases now they think that's what killed off the Mayans. That's what killed off 90% of the Native Americans. It was their COVID. Yeah, it was. It was smallpox and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's that, COVID</p>
<p class="body">Oh, right, right right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All kinds of diseases they brought with them from Europe they killed everybody in the Amazon</p>
<p class="body">They're finding civilizations in the Amazon that housed millions of people, and they're finding them through this thing called Lidar where they fly over in jets because the jungles overtaken all these cities</p>
<p class="body">So they used to be cities of millions of people in the Amazon, and the Europeans showed up</p>
<p class="body">And they just got him sick and everybody died. And then when people came back to look for these cities like 50 years later, they were gone, just like Detroit's almost gone. Detroit's got houses where trees are grown</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In the middle there, yeah, but this is even crazier because it's in the middle of the jungle</p>
<p class="body">So it's happening quicker, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yo OK, Europeans just came over and just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Murked Merkt everybody merkt everybody with their cooties</p>
<p class="body">Europeans came over here with their</p>
<p class="body">Cooties, and the biggest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">They're putting smallpox on blankets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no no</p>
<p class="body">That's a myth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That's meal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">A myth, yeah, most likely</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Like they should tell us that in school</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Most likely I I heard about that too and I looked into it</p>
<p class="body">They don't think they isolated smallpox that way</p>
<p class="body">They don't think they understood it that way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I was just saying that that</p>
<p class="body">Was that'd be pretty</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
******* genius they made, but they made COVID for sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It would be</p>
<p class="body">The thing is they they probably did</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
'cause it's airborne</p>
<p class="body">So yeah, they were just getting this **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In there it's everybody was getting it and it killed 90% of the Native Americans</p>
90% of them man is the I mean you think about a disease that kills 9</p>
<p class="body">Of 10 people</p>
<p class="body">And it just swept through the entire continent</p>
<p class="body">And you know, all the Mayans they were trying to figure out what the where the **** did these people go? </p>
<p class="body">They made chicha nizza which? </p>
<p class="body">Is have you ever been down there? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">No, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Dude, I went down there</p>
<p class="body">It's wild</p>
<p class="body">You walk amongst this place you're</p>
<p class="body">Like what is this? </p>
<p class="body">How did they do this? </p>
<p class="body">They they did this? </p>
<p class="body">Like 1000 plus years ago like what is this? What the **** is this? It's all lying to the different constellations. They have a room that they have set up just to do psychedelic drugs in yo yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, we had a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Drug we had a guy who was a guide who was a professor</p>
<p class="body">This really interesting guy</p>
<p class="body">We hired this Mexican gentleman who knew everything about the Mayans, and he spoke fluent English and Spanish, so he explained it to you in Spanish and explain it to you in English</p>
<p class="body">And he said this was a whole area that where they take these leaves that contain lysergic acid which is like</p>
<p class="body">LSD and he was explaining this to me and he</p>
<p class="body">Didn't even know</p>
<p class="body">That I like to do drunk right he</p>
<p class="body">He was just telling me like I'm like a civilian like yeah and I'm like OK keep talking I'm like I knew it I ******* knew it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">He's drooling</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They had to be doing something right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, I mean to think about, yeah, all the ingenuity and all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There was so much more advanced</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That I mean</p>
<p class="body">I'll say this about that the I mean you're saying Europeans guarded this yeah? </p>
<p class="body">You know, we weren't</p>
<p class="body">We were alive for World War Two, but this conflict is the 1st</p>
<p class="body">Time I've seen</p>
<p class="body">White people fight white people, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Like this is kind of</p>
<p class="body">I feel like this this may change</p>
<p class="body">Some things in the history</p>
<p class="body">Books and for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, you time I would do Russia</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Russia in the Ukraine</p>
<p class="body">Like I'm I've never seen this</p>
<p class="body">You know it's always us and you know the Middle East, something</p>
<p class="body">Like that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Exactly right, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but now this is like this is wise versus wise</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">It a it is a new kind</p>
<p class="body">Of it is a new kind of thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah you</p>
<p class="body">I've never this in the history books will see that</p>
<p class="body">So I think there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a progression in a way I think people will see like oh, it's not just these guys are</p>
<p class="body">Evil white people can be evil too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">In the modern era, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a human, there's Hitler</p>
<p class="body">It's it's a human thing where people can get to a certain place where they have a certain amount of power and they want to hold onto it and they do evil **** It's a human thing</p>

<p class="body">These these yeah they got a politician Bich I seen with the ************ 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's so much lies</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">Not a chance</p>
<p class="body">Bro they got me with a parody</p>
<p class="body">They they showed Steven Segal</p>
<p class="body">It was like a uh somebody made a parody of a CNN article</p>
<p class="body">It's a Steven Segal is in the in Ukraine and I was like Oh my God, if this is real and I lazily looked for like 5 minutes and then I couldn't find if it was fake or real and I just posted it and saying that we're about 14 hours from the aliens landing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I saw this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And people were like, why did you believe it's real? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Under siege</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll tell you why</p>
<p class="body">Steven Segal was listed as a threat to the ******* nation of Ukraine in 2017. Yeah, they won't let him in the country. He's he's banned</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Why not? It's a threat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, he's a threat to national Steven Segal above the law the actor look</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Wait, what? </p>
<p class="body">Under siege</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">At my Instagram page, look at my Instagram page. He Washington Post story from ******* 2017. It's a legit news source</p>
<p class="body">He was labeled a threat to national security above the law</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">OK he is though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That guy in Ukraine</p>
<p class="body">So when I saw that he was in Ukraine, it was a parody</p>
<p class="body">I was like I could believe that I can't believe that have you seen? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">It I'm trying to find the the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Link, just right? Steven Segal banned from Ukraine 2017</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Here's the paper</p>
<p class="body">His way to be</p>
<p class="body">Able to be in the country</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">I know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So this movie plot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Plug in over the searches</p>
<p class="body">There we go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, this is it</p>
<p class="body">Ukraine band Steven Seagal threat to national security</p>
<p class="body">Bro, what the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
**** that bigger fat as **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's so crazy</p>
<p class="body">What he does is a thing called Aikido and it's a very unusual martial art in that it's really designed for samurais to fight someone with a sword</p>
<p class="body">So if you lose your your sword in combat, this is the origins of it</p>
<p class="body">If you lose your sword and you come after a dude who knows Aikido, he tries to transfer the energy of your attack</p>
<p class="body">Encounter you and throw you just like throws and trips and a lot of clothesline stuff and Steven Segal Steven Segal adopted it to movies and made it very fun</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like inertia</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause it did seem like a lot of ************* that was fighting him was like running into</p>
<p class="body">Him and just getting sucked up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Of course, of course, but that wasn't choreographed</p>
<p class="body">You know it wasn't with a lot of their stuff is choreographed unfortunately, but there is some legitimacy to some of their movements</p>
<p class="body">There's some legitimacy to these wristlocks and controlling arms and throwing people</p>
<p class="body">The problem is it won't work on someone who's like a really good wrestler</p>
<p class="body">It's like it's like one of those things we get</p>
<p class="body">Really good at and being expert at it, but you still won't be as good as an expert in another martial art</p>
<p class="body">This is Steven Seagal</p>
<p class="body">Steven Seagal was a legit aikido black belt, but like look at this look at these guys attacking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He's just throwing him to the ground</p>
<p class="body">Let me tell you something</p>
<p class="body">If Daniel Cormier shot in on that</p>
<p class="body">Dude and got ahold of</p>
<p class="body">His legs crushed</p>
<p class="body">He hoist him up in the air and drop him on his head</p>
100% of the time the the difference between what? </p>
<p class="body">He's doing and</p>
<p class="body">He's a master at Aikido</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, he really is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He's a</p>
<p class="body">Master, but the difference is</p>
<p class="body">It's not as good or is not as effective a martial art as wrestling, or as judo</p>
<p class="body">Or as jujitsu, it's an interesting martial art, but when it comes to like being able to take people down, nobody can **** with judo when it comes to like with the guy grabbing sleeves and throwing, and when it comes to like taking people down</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Why anybody throwing no more ******* punches? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, just double legs and single legs</p>
<p class="body">No one can **** with wrestlers so you have no one can **** with the throws of judo guys</p>
<p class="body">No one can **** with the takedowns of wrestlers versus this</p>
<p class="body">It's not a bad thing to learn</p>
<p class="body">It's interesting, it's good for your health</p>
<p class="body">You get some exercise in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, sure, but yeah that that look crazy come</p>
<p class="body">On now man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">It's not cheap</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Actually, that's not realistic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Would have read up on that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah now so somebody</p>
<p class="body">Yeah somebody getting jumped into a gang like like let's see</p>
<p class="body">Somebody getting jumped</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But this, but let me tell you something he does know how to strike</p>
<p class="body">A little bit like Aikido does have he does</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">OK jam yeah right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Steven Segal does like no no ******** He knows how to close</p>
<p class="body">He does got</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of it, is kind of nonsensical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, Steven Segal I'm talking **** Don't **** me up</p>
<p class="body">I was talking **** man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Also, he's a big ******* dude. He's 100 years old. He's 100 years old, but he's he's a big dude</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">He is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like 6-4</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Also, he know how to block all the punches and all that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He knows how to</p>
<p class="body">Like no, you just because someone is kind of funny</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of funny he's, you know, he's kind of a character, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The karate Phil Jackson</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He's kind of a karate</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of like a traditional martial arts character, but</p>
<p class="body">He still is a real legit martial artist, even though he's kind of funny</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He does a lot of wacky movies and **** at the end</p>
<p class="body">He's, but he's a</p>
<p class="body">He runs weird inspired</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">He a whole generation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He's a bro</p>
<p class="body">He I loved him in above the law and above the law</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It's it's here because Steven</p>

<p class="body">Favorite ones look at the difference man</p>
<p class="body">He was so thin back then, but like this **** seemed it seemed at least partially believable like he seems like a guy who really does understand martial arts movements and they're they're much more realistic than, say, like a dude doing a jumping sidekick to one dudes</p>
<p class="body">Face or kicking two dudes at the same time doing the splits like we were used to that we were seeing a lot of that in like Jackie Chan movies and it was fun and</p>

<p class="body">It happened in the middle</p>
<p class="body">Of the ocean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, underwater is</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's like it's it's close enough to just explosion</p>

<p class="body">Is it are we talking about the same one? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's an underwater volcano, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah underwater volcano that you could see from space</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">And it blew off part of</p>
<p class="body">The island good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, you could see it from space</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Lord, judge</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Look at this, that's from space</p>
<p class="body">Just a random explosion that's underwater, so here's the crazy thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I guess</p>
<p class="body">They came from underwater</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There was a uh, thing</p>
<p class="body">I think it's called the Toba volcano</p>
<p class="body">Is that what it is? </p>
<p class="body">Jamie in Indonesia? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Same spot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">It's almost the, it's just a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Same spot, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Little bit, probably largest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So that area is responsible for an eruption</p>
<p class="body">A volcanic eruption that occurred somewhere around 70,000 years ago that almost wiped out the entire human race. It brought the entire human race down to about 7000 people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">What year was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This this was about 70,000 years ago. OK, so 70,000 years ago, everyone you know</p>
<p class="body">Everyone on this ******* planet came from these few 1000 people that survived. They don't know exactly how many, but they estimate it could be as low as 7000 people, but mostly decimated the population of Earth from</p>
<p class="body">From a giant volcano that spewed ash into the sky, killed all the vegetation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Welcome</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Wait a minute</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Killed all the sunlight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Only 7000 people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Only 7000 people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So how does race even exist then? </p>
<p class="body">Because that that's your human race, right? </p>
<p class="body">There right 'cause? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's all ******** It's all where we live</p>
<p class="body">If you live in Africa, you're gonna get darker skin slowly over time</p>
<p class="body">If you live in Europe, you're gonna need more vitamin D</p>
<p class="body">You can only get it from the sun</p>
<p class="body">There's no ******* sun, so you get paler and paler and</p>
<p class="body">Paler after generation after generation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, so there's more of an ethnicity in a regional or cultural thing, so it's not Even so</p>
<p class="body">If whatever this social construct races, yeah, we should</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We just look different. That's all it is. We just look different with the same exact 100% thing</p>
<p class="body">It's not like a wolf that's trying to have sex with a cat</p>
<p class="body">We you know what I'm saying, there's one race, we just look different because we have different genetics</p>
'cause we came from different parts of the world</p>
<p class="body">That's all it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But my Nega said that **** loud or tell, hey, where's that compilation at? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's, but it's just so confusing to people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like a Joe Rogan out here saying this whole yay human race human race joke</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But that is all we get with. This is like 100% accurate. You know I'm a mutt. I'm a mix of a bunch of **** but it's mostly Italians</p>
<p class="body">And then I've got like some Irish people in there and some African and I got some, some Asia, a little bit of Asia in there, but it's like we're all some weird cross of all these people that started out in some spot</p>
<p class="body">And how to survive massive cataclysmic disasters? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">True, I'm 98% in Nigeria. Whoa, that's what the 23 would be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">This is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Diggers told me all no bigger I could be some other **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Who knows, they say Jamaican and Native American</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I think Negers was here. I think some was here in America before we before slavery. I think we</p>
<p class="body">Was here already</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what Hotep Jesus believes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, Hotep Jesus was telling me that on my podcast and I was like, well, why not people traveled from everywhere for shipbuilders? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Well the 1st</p>
<p class="body">They said they were Africans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Were they really? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah you look that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">One up, yeah, first build were Africans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, that makes sense</p>

<p class="body">Right, they used to build ships for everybody, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">And then, uh</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">So even if I had a ship, but they could go any</p>
******* way you wanted, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So if you look at some of the</p>
<p class="body">Old old mix</p>

<p class="body">Emerged because of hockey</p>
<p class="body">Is that real? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, is that real? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, that's great</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Like what public schools emerged 'cause of hockey? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Get him in class</p>
<p class="body">So yeah, they'll</p>
<p class="body">Go play hockey</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That is crazy, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like an incentive you imagine if</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Hockey was how they figured</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Out schools I think</p>
<p class="body">I mean maybe it was a bunch of rich guys that I got my hockey team</p>
<p class="body">Now Nick, I got my hockey team alright</p>
<p class="body">I got my school</p>
<p class="body">They started school</p>
<p class="body">You know I'm saying I'm gonna start my school</p>
<p class="body">Maybe that's how they did it, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, so they'll structure though</p>
<p class="body">So how? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I I can see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You because you want rugby then rugby should</p>
<p class="body">The fighting you should fight in rugby</p>
<p class="body">You could fight in hockey</p>
<p class="body">You can't fight in rugby</p>
<p class="body">That's ridiculous</p>
<p class="body">Rugby can</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Crush a guy like I was gonna say like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is uh, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Rugby is already</p>
<p class="body">Is a fight you know, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And they don't have any helmets</p>
<p class="body">On yeah oh gosh</p>
<p class="body">It off, you know they say that that's safer</p>
<p class="body">Believe it or not, that American football that the the problem with the head, like the helmets and the shoulder coverings</p>
<p class="body">The head coverings is that they make you feel like you're protected, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You're not really no, I I, but yeah, I think it's the helmet bro that helmet coming right at you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm gonna be smacking the **** out, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But but 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The thing is, we're so scared of the transition period between helmets and no helmets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean making like making lacrosse helmets, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Before they figure it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That you can't give anybody any padding on their head and allow them to smash</p>
<p class="body">People in the heads</p>
<p class="body">That's what I'm saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So if these guys are going to put their schools against schools</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, So what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Have you got? Yeah, if you're a bigger guy and that guy's got a smaller head, that's a terrifying place to be. If you're that smaller guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, it's like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Just like this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, we had talked to hit people</p>
<p class="body">In the face, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Why fighting is allowed in the NHL? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh here we go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">There's no real right answer here that I got to, but I was just as I'm reading that like the third time, they do fight in baseball</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They do now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But don't they break it up? </p>
<p class="body">Immediately they break it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They break that up</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, they break this break</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Up and no, but they let him</p>
<p class="body">They let him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They let him, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Toss them around no no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They they break it up in hockey, but those guys</p>
<p class="body">Get like well like 2 minutes</p>
<p class="body">Like timeout and go right back in penalty time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">It it depends like it's it's gone down over time, but for like I was looking at some baseball things like Reggie Jackson hit a home run and then went and fought the guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That was the</p>
70s though my my</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Advertising migrate change times my grandfather</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Was a Yankees fan, so I used to have to watch those games</p>
<p class="body">I was a little kid</p>
<p class="body">I used to watch those games with my grandpa</p>
<p class="body">He loved it, man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Those guys are so many drugs, the 70s and the 80s were cool for baseball</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The Reggie Jackson days</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm sorry, baseball</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, I don't</p>
<p class="body">Think they had the right science, though they didn't have the right science</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You're not even a sport right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Like what's really was interesting is the Mark McGwire years</p>
<p class="body">What they gotta do is like juicy, juicy, juicy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The science</p>
<p class="body">The science, yes, smacking this **** out of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's this thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">The ball ******** how they kept him</p>
<p class="body">Barry Bonds out</p>
<p class="body">The Hall of Fame</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's ******** it is ******** because there's a lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That is an error</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There was a lot of people that were taking it and they just they were better than everybody else</p>
<p class="body">It's like the Lance Armstrong argument, like you want to say that Lance Armstrong doesn't deserve to win the Tour de France</p>
<p class="body">Well, everybody was on drugs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Everybody is doping</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The whole Tour de France was on drugs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, everybody is doping, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They're all doping</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but that's also like then they say the same thing about the 70s era when they're on methamphetamine</p>
<p class="body">Exactly, you know exactly so, like why these guys bad because they broke those great records</p>
<p class="body">As Babe Ruth is their pinnacle, you can't beat those records</p>
<p class="body">And then was killed Hank Aaron for that you know</p>
<p class="body">And I mean, I don't</p>
<p class="body">I wasn't alive during the era, but I, I, Hank Aaron era</p>
<p class="body">But I I believe they probably said he was juice and went weren't</p>
<p class="body">They like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, I don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">He's a cheat, probably he's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I never heard that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">On something, no I never</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Did they say that I never heard? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I got it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That yeah, I never heard that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, right, sorry I can't care</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't think they knew what juice was back</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm just trying to help look at you</p>
<p class="body">I'm trying</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm out here</p>
<p class="body">I'm misinformation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's that should be a girl that does **** misinformation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I think she's a</p>
<p class="body">Radio DJ actually yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, there is is a radio DJ name</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I think that they didn't discover that **** until Eastern Bloc nation started</p>
<p class="body">They started experimenting on it with Olympic athletes and you started seeing women Olympic athletes that were posting up numbers that I think even Googled this 'cause I think there's some like powerlifting numbers from Eastern Bloc nations</p>
<p class="body">From the early days for drug testing that they still haven't beaten</p>
<p class="body">Yeah like dude</p>
<p class="body">They they engineered people</p>
<p class="body">Back then there was an article I read about this lady who was in that program and she was like a weightlifter and they like she basically</p>
<p class="body">Was forced to take hormones and it ruined her</p>
<p class="body">Really having children she could never have children and she was just talking about like what awkward **** it did to her body</p>
'cause back then man they would just they just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They were science experiments, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They didn't give a **** man, you're gonna win for the Soviet Union like you take that drug</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right though yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, you have a you don't have a choice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's like it's like you know there's a lot of Communist countries that just to decide what you're gonna do</p>
<p class="body">And if you're a woman and you you show promise at weightlifting and and they want you to represent Russia back in the 1950s or 60s, whatever it was, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Gymnastics, right? </p>
<p class="body">Ice skating</p>
<p class="body">Cycling all of it now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, this is what we're realizing</p>
<p class="body">What this warm and it's like it's so this is a people thing like people like to control people</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter if they're Russian or Chinese or wherever the **** they're from</p>
<p class="body">American Canadian</p>
<p class="body">Look at what's going on in Canada</p>
<p class="body">Well, they they froze the assets</p>
<p class="body">All those people that contributed to the truckers that were trying to like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Like what are you doing? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh shoot</p>
<p class="body">They did that for it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They froze the assets</p>
<p class="body">They they froze, people, assets, they they</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if they've released them</p>
<p class="body">I think they they eventually ultimately released them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, where are people rights to protest, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well man it's like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Canada is a democracy, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a thing that people want to learn, look, running things and ruling over people is gotta be very ******* complicated</p>
<p class="body">It's very difficult to do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's so hard to do and so hard to do when you have like all these different pressures from all these different businesses that have contributed to your campaigns and people that want you to do one thing or the other thing</p>
<p class="body">Goddamnit, it's got to be hard to do and and one of the easiest impulse is one of the most normal human impulses</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I can help</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is just tell people shut the FCK up</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to do this now</p>
<p class="body">We're going to impose this</p>
<p class="body">We're going to pose to do law</p>
<p class="body">We're going to keep this law</p>
<p class="body">It's a natural thing that people want to do when they get in charge, and you're not supposed to be able to do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And the people that like voted with him, that's a mistake you're not supposed to give people new powers</p>
<p class="body">The the amount of power they have is enough</p>
<p class="body">Those powers supposed to be reserved for terrorist attacks and **** wild stuff, you know, like people trying to overthrow the government, not people that are protesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Not your own</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Like you gotta, you gotta be able to tolerate a certain amount of protesting, right? </p>
<p class="body">You have to be, there's it has to be discourse</p>
'cause otherwise you're gonna make new laws to make your life more convenient and easy, right? </p>
<p class="body">Real reason is no one should be a president</p>
<p class="body">No one, no one should be a Prime Minister</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No one person should get that much juice</p>
6 and I don't think they have</p>
<p class="body">In America</p>
<p class="body">I think this is a good example 'cause I think that with Biden it's probably a lot of people helping him out, and it's probably a gigantic group effort, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Nobody is saying **** to Putin</p>
<p class="body">No right, no? </p>
<p class="body">You know that's a different kind of thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Nobody checking my man, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">When when a? </p>
<p class="body">Person gets to that spot that crazy super position where they can just call out whatever they want done, get to force things attack</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">The only the only other ************ I remember running Russia was Mikhail Gorbachev, and after that it was just been putting the rest of my life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How about Khrushchev? In the 1960s, Khrushchev pulled his shoe out and banged it on the desk and said, I will bury you right bro, do you remember you mean that what I'm see that you need to see that because this is like post nuclear weapons first being deployed</p>
<p class="body">This was in the Cold War</p>
<p class="body">Could have been hot war</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">In the 70s</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This is the time no, this is like</p>
<p class="body">When he did that with Khrushchev, I want to</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what year it was, I'm thinking</p>
<p class="body">I'm thinking this was during like the Kennedy years 1960. Yeah 1960 he took his ******* shoe off and banged it on the desk and said I will bury you. Do you understand how terrifying that would have been? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">OK, all the candy era</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Was he talking? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">To too hard</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Russians to us to us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, Russians go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
******* who knows how many people starved to death in Russia, Russia, Russia was graphically horrific LY, treated by its rulers and by history and fate, and that goes back to the ******* invading them in the 1200s</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I horrific</p>
<p class="body">Right, so it's just in there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Dude, they've had a long history of conflict</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It's in their roots, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">These are these are fierce people and you see in the UFC right now there's these Russians that are coming over and ******* dominating in the UFC</p>
<p class="body">There's so many of them it's like a high population of Russians</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I've been</p>
<p class="body">I've been to Russia too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a hard place</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's cold as **** and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Know is it third world strong no third world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">People are straight</p>
<p class="body">No, not at all</p>
<p class="body">It's just a different</p>
<p class="body">They're they're just hard people myth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't like the vibe, I'm good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I said I said put in my man on here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, goodness</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I gotta clarify that that person urban vernacular</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I wouldn't twice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's a vernacular</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, don't don't put me on the list</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you know that Louis CK was doing a show he was supposed to be doing a show in Ukraine when the **** hit the fan? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh I, I read about that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Dude, I text</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it was on Twitter</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, he's on talking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">About it yeah, I wanna read his texts, it's pretty hilarious</p>
<p class="body">He sounds terrifying attending that he was staring</p>
<p class="body">He was</p>
<p class="body">He wasn't</p>
<p class="body">He was pretty to make to make to me in text message</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Pretending he was there, like oh man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Just be to be funny</p>
<p class="body">He's like I'm ****** he, he said no, I got out this is crazy and he's explaining and he got</p>
<p class="body">He's doing like some European no</p>
<p class="body">But imagine Sean Penn is</p>
<p class="body">Over there right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Dog over there seeing right over there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Here it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, they're over there, just like documented</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">In Russia</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Hoping they don't get killed, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, this is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Or Ukraine or Ukraine</p>

<p class="body">You know, I've I've never right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">In our lifetime</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It's what I'm saying</p>
<p class="body">This is the first time I've seen this kind of conflict with white people</p>
<p class="body">I'm like this is hardly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know what it's like</p>
<p class="body">This is like slaps</p>
<p class="body">But like if you're gonna get a street fight, this is like by using conventional weapons</p>
<p class="body">It's like slaps before they start throwing haymakers</p>
<p class="body">We gotta be really terrified of haymakers</p>
'cause if haymakers come and I know this is a bad analogy 'cause people are dying, I don't mean it that way, but I mean is like it'll escalate to the point where everybody is dead</p>
<p class="body">That's what's terrifying to me</p>
<p class="body">It's terrifying to me is that he's what has he done with his nukes? </p>
<p class="body">What does Putin done with nukes? </p>
<p class="body">There was like something</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">He's in perpetual motion, fainting and jabbing, cutting angles</p>
<p class="body">And his footwork is superb</p>
<p class="body">I mean, Anthony Joshua is such a power puncher man and to to stand in front of him like that and just keep pressing forward and get clipped too</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They gotta javelins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The thing</p>
<p class="body">He's like where does this go like? </p>
<p class="body">How do how do? </p>
<p class="body">How do they end this? </p>
<p class="body">How they end this without people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's like devalue life like that, that's all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm saying terrifying because it leads like if you can justify killing 10,000 people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You can justify killing 100,000 people and justify 100. You can justify a million that</p>
<p class="body">Then can keep going</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">When you talk about genocide, yeah, the genocide paying people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And yeah, if you feel like there was a time during the 1960s where these generals were talking about nuking China or nuking Russia, that you could eliminate it very quickly and that you could do it fast</p>
<p class="body">And we would only lose like a few million people in the United States and they were like willing to give it a go</p>
<p class="body">Whoa yeah, yeah there were real generals like real generals, Oliver Stone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Power over people's lives like that's crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oliver Stone was explaining this to me</p>
<p class="body">He's like they the the guy was the inspiration for the Doctor Strange love movie</p>
<p class="body">You know the Doctor Strange ever see that? </p>
<p class="body">However, Doctor Strange loves a crazy movie from early days like it's like 65 or something like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I've only heard about I haven't seen it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And it's all about these generals sitting around wanting to go to war, wanting to and</p>
<p class="body">And they were talking one of the guys was talking</p>
<p class="body">It sounded like a parody like he was talking like</p>
<p class="body">Well, we'll probably lose Chicago, and you know, maybe a couple other places, but for the most part, we'll have limited amount</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, basically a documentary Doctor Strange Love is basically documentary</p>
<p class="body">Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Doctor Strange Love is a black comedy that ends with the world being completely destroyed in a nuclear war</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Many aspects of the film might seem absurd, but according to Daniel Ellsberg, who worked as a nuclear war planner in the 1960s, it's actually pretty close to reality. He says that was a documentary</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Well the get outta here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Ellsberg says in episode 297 of Geek's guide to the Galaxy Podcast Everything that film entered existed as an operational reality at the time</p>
<p class="body">He says that while specific doomsday machine featuring Doctor Strange Love is fictional, the Russians and the Americans nuclear arsenals function as de facto doomsday machines since the first strike by either power</p>
<p class="body">Against other would be more than enough to plunge the world into nuclear war, and so they really were trying to do this, so there were really were some wild ask generals from the 1960s that were thinking we might have to nuke them before they nuke us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean it did I mean it, it did Hiroshima and Nagasaki so I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">However, peoples lives us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They did it, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Mean so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So they did</p>
<p class="body">Yeah they did it, they did it</p>
<p class="body">They did it exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">They wiped out those cities so they did it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's amazing</p>
<p class="body">We haven't done it since</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I thank God</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, thank God absolutely</p>
<p class="body">But it's amazing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But now more countries have this</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's real</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What would that suitcase do? </p>
<p class="body">Detonate a city</p>
<p class="body">How much power is in a suitcase nuke? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>

<p class="body">Dude, it's terrifying what what human beings are capable of doing to each other is terrifying, because also capable of being cool as **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Why is that in this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right dude, I I'm what we're just talking about earlier</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, we even make a nuclear weapon</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I think it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">This is what? </p>
<p class="body">I'm saying like, why can't we use this power to like figure out how to find other intelligent life out there? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The problem with nuclear powers that someone was going to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Make it right, and that's exactly as soon as it's out there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Someone was gonna</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Why don't they weaponize it though? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, Oppenheimer in the Manhattan Project did it to try to end the war because they felt like the war was going to go the wrong way and Hitler was going to take over the world</p>
<p class="body">Now if Hitler took over the world, we obviously be ****** right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean what happened during World War Two? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">We would yeah</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Change the course of history, but you know it</p>
<p class="body">It didn't have to</p>
<p class="body">If the Germans figured it out quicker bro, they figured out a lot of **** They figured out all kinds of race car technology that you know how many, ******* 
<p class="body">Like Elite world car manufacturers came out of Germany, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">They they had advanced technology, so much so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The science that came out of that too, because of the</p>
<p class="body">Experiments they were</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Doing yes</p>
<p class="body">Well, you know what operation? </p>

So much so that</p>
<p class="body">The same Simon Wiesenthal Center at one point in time said if he was alive today, they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity</p>

<p class="body">Yes, that was real</p>
<p class="body">What where is this during the Holocaust during the Holocaust during World War Two, Wernher von Braun ran a rocket factory, and they had Jews work as slaves</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, got to be, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Yeah 'cause then though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what I'm saying. It's the number one cause of death of people 18 to I think 18 to 49 overdose</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Overdosing right now they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">They put all opioids together so 75,000</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Opioid I just typed in opioid overdoses per year, top thing, CDC drug overdoses per deaths. The new data documents that estimated overdose deaths from opioids increased to 75,673 in the last 12 month period ending April 2021</p>

<p class="body">They probably make</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
19 four became illegal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
20 I mean man, they don't</p>
<p class="body">They though isn't, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That that's basically</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's 100%, it's 100% it's synthetic go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">What it is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Back to that Jamie</p>
<p class="body">Look at this. When did heroin became illegal in 1924? After a few decades of legal use heroin use and misuse</p>
<p class="body">Rose rapidly became clear that heroin was a highly addictive substance. United States government made heroin illegal in 1924, so this was so. By the way, this was legal during the prohibition era</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That's because that's just because they couldn't</p>
<p class="body">That's it, that is because they didn't know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Up until 24, right? So you can still. You can still see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">How to send the prohibition end when the prohibition end? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">The third, yeah, it lasted for a while, but it started</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But when part of what? 1921, nineteen 20? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">They had</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, they had some movements that didn't take off for a while and then</p>
<p class="body">One finally stopped</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Listen man, if you could get away with not getting arrested during those days, you know fun would be to be drunk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, not for us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah right, yeah yeah yeah, we can't do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">We can't really go back in time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But imagine if we could</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if there was a time like today like if they made out if they probably they found out that alcohol was like the source of the resistance like the all the if they did studies and they found out you know people are more willing to do a lot of things if they just don't drink</p>
<p class="body">If there's too much</p>
****** in drinking</p>
<p class="body">We gotta make drinking illegal</p>
<p class="body">It's a CT liver sclerosis and it's contributing to the environmental problem that we're experiencing</p>
<p class="body">If they just make alcohol illegal, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It it could have been a, it could been the hospital thing again</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you know how fun it would be? </p>
<p class="body">But do you know? </p>
<p class="body">How fun it would be to be drunk if alcohol was illegal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah it was</p>
<p class="body">Though you look at that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It would be so fun</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean it created mobsters in America, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it did</p>
<p class="body">Al Capone made a lot of his money from Prohibition</p>
<p class="body">A lot of</p>

<p class="body">Al Jolson was like the first black faced guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Blackface minstrel</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">The minstrel guy from like</p>
<p class="body">The early 1900s like look at this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, he wasn't</p>
<p class="body">He wasn't the first he was</p>
<p class="body">The most famous he was the most</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Famous well well, one of the first</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, are you that ***** ** **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is what I meant to say</p>
<p class="body">But so this guy back then like he would? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, you gotta imagine what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean my God</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Year is this</p>
<p class="body">What year is this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That is that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Is the first movie with sound 19</p>
2719 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So in 1927, this is how far human beings have</p>
<p class="body">Gone in 100 years</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Talking so the minstrel shows in the in the mid 1900s they were 1900 like the most popular form of entertainment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's stop and think about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">What number? </p>
<p class="body">What was so entertaining about being a Nigar? </p>
<p class="body">To them, that's what I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">White people hated black people bro back then</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">This is also what it was like</p>
<p class="body">The human race was emerging into a new understanding of what's ******** and what's not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right post Civil war, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah what, what's OK and what's not OK and this this was the first time they've ever experimenting with media. You got to realize in like the 1920s, like they're making movies the 1st movies, everyone</p>
<p class="body">Anyone ever seen so? </p>
<p class="body">No one understands what it's like to make something that a lot of people are going to see</p>
<p class="body">No one knows what it's like to to to like, see something like this in a in a in a movie and then also they have this thing where they don't want a black person to play this role</p>
<p class="body">They want a white guy to pretend he's a black guy</p>
<p class="body">Which is just crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That's kind of way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
'cause he doesn't look, uh, he looks like a guy with makeup on</p>
<p class="body">He does not</p>
<p class="body">This is like completely unrealistic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">This is the night shift, though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Look at that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The minstrel shows, I mean like the other ones aren't this nice, you know? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, like they're literally just portraying, like eating watermelon and and, you know, acting like like runaway slaves</p>
<p class="body">And you know, this is this is a little more stand up and they want to be a little more classy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's so crazy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">You know this is like Gatsby, Robert Downey junior did this **** in a Tropic Thunder</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, I talked to Jamie Foxx about that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">How yeah, how did people really? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>

<p class="body">He can do Biden</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">He doesn't get Michael Jackson</p>

<p class="body">He does everybody</p>
<p class="body">Oh my God, that Michael Jackson was ruthless</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">So it's not so it's not black price if they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">That was ruthless</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Do say, like the defect, can you blackface with deep fakes? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a very good question, right? </p>
<p class="body">If you're a white guy and you have to do like Samuel Jackson, is that what you have to face swaps? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Samuel Jackson, that's blackface</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You have to face swaps and that is kinda</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's that's new blackface</p>
<p class="body">That's digital blackface digital blackface</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, so the only way you'd be comfortable with that is if it was a black guy doing Sammy Jackson voice</p>
<p class="body">If there's a black guy who was an impressionist</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, because they're doing it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's it's</p>
<p class="body">They're doing a caricature</p>
<p class="body">What they think is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And then they have, like the Samuel Jackson face swap</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">A black person</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's good, yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That's cool, but do white people get mad with? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm just trying to lay down the laws for white people so everybody understands</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">No, I mean white people</p>
<p class="body">White people get mad when Dave Chappelle do whiteface? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, nobody gives a FCK nobody gives a FCK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Or white chicks</p>
<p class="body">Or you know, yeah, Eddie Murphy, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, but Dave Chappelle in particular</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Because it's always punching down for white people</p>
<p class="body">That's what it is</p>
<p class="body">That's it's asserting power over people because they're the majority</p>
<p class="body">So when every time a black person does it, we're just punching up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, Pryor had the the best version of it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">If we had a way of using a telescope into space</p>
<p class="body">To check out another planet</p>
<p class="body">When we saw America in 1950, we'd be like, Oh my God, look</p>
<p class="body">At these dorks, right though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Separated dressed up I mean like yeah</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Removed from</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Straight barbarianism like like in 1920? How many years of electricity are we even talking about? </p>
<p class="body">Is it 100? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, I think it's still wet kerosene, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What year, like what year did electricity get distributed across the entire country? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">It depends</p>
<p class="body">It depends what city you were in</p>
'cause La Place didn't have it for me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">Right, well let's go with Chicago when</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">That's I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">Asked the Chicago world fair. Like 1898, they short sort of showed it all. I mean they had it, but they showed it off so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He showed up OK</p>
<p class="body">So at the very so, this is that's almost 1900. This is only 5060 years later</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, right, that ain't **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
**** man</p>
<p class="body">No, that's it</p>
<p class="body">Just small window of time and all of a sudden we have electric ******* record players</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, we're doing everything</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, we got flying cars but like</p>
<p class="body">Three years I hope not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll go ahead</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But I mean between those 60 years between no electricity and then movies</p>
<p class="body">Chicago World's Fair 1893 wow</p>
1893% President Grover Cleveland pushed a button that lit nearly 100,000 incandescent lamps illuminating the city</p>
<p class="body">Demonstrating how electricity will forever change the nation, making it readily available to residents everywhere</p>
<p class="body">Wow, Can you imagine being alive the day they hit the switch? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, that's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No electricity ever, no electricity ever</p>
<p class="body">And then all of</p>
<p class="body">A sudden kecheng</p>
<p class="body">Chunk chunk, well, that's true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That that creates night life, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, in essence, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">That's what it looked like</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">I think that's what they lit up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, not it not you was riding around with your buggy holding you</p>
<p class="body">Got damn Leonards right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Or yeah, you work</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Or but you know what the problem is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's the way it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">As soon as they turn that on, you stop seeing the stars</p>
<p class="body">Exactly, that's the real ******** The biggest advancement in human technological history is electricity</p>
'cause it allowed</p>
<p class="body">All the other advancements to come out or out of it, whether it's electronics or whatever the **** it is, everything has to be powered by electricity, right? </p>
<p class="body">When you turn it on, you can't see the stars anymore, so you get confused</p>
<p class="body">So people only focus on their tasks</p>
<p class="body">It's almost like a little drug like a little sedative drug that keeps us from seeing the cosmos</p>
<p class="body">So you only see like a blank slate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They'd let a lot of people out really early with COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">They did a lot of people talk, that's why</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Crime rate is up</p>
<p class="body">The crime rate is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So do you think that this is a? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">In Los Angeles 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Why do you think that people mismanage things? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think it's a conspiracy? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think they want like a certain amount of chaos? </p>
<p class="body">Do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Think what do you think? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Pandemic did a lot of crazy things to people I'd ever seen</p>
<p class="body">What happened to humanity in America like I've seen what happened during the pandemic log? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">To their minds, right to their minds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, everybody a little bit more nuts and on the on the coast</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, well, they're a little bit more</p>
<p class="body">They're hangry at random **** that goes on that doesn't necessarily make sense</p>
<p class="body">You know, like there's, there was a certain amount of ridiculousness that would be attached to getting mad about things that weren't really that infuriating</p>
<p class="body">And then over time the like, it seems like the more safety people have, the more they come up with **** that ****** them off</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So just excuse to get pist</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Off, yeah, I think people like finding</p>
<p class="body">Enemies and anger other than themselves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It's interesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And I think it's a natural thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Just in case</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I think we got two things going on simultaneously that we talked about earlier</p>
<p class="body">We got the tribal thing where we we all every human on this planet originated from</p>
<p class="body">We originated from a small group of people trying to defend themselves against other small groups of people that were trying to steal resources until they figured out</p>
<p class="body">Agriculture and how to compound cities together. That's how relatively new man like according to these people that study the human genome, it takes like 10,000 years to see like these big changes in your DNA</p>
<p class="body">We we have like the DNA of people that live thousands and thousands of years ago, they'd be identical to us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right generational ******* trauma yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And they are</p>
<p class="body">These imprinted memories of going to war with neighbors</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Do you know how, like when the dark, like every child, no matter where you live, when it's dark? </p>
<p class="body">What are you scared of? </p>
<p class="body">Monster monsters you know why? </p>
<p class="body">Because we used to get eaten by cats</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right yeah, big lines yeah, big cats</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We were afraid we are afraid of lions and Jaguars and leopards and big cats</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that would get us out of there</p>
<p class="body">Our houses, our shelters</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">We weren't top of the food chain right, but we invented weapons and we became that right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They weren't</p>
<p class="body">We weren't top of the food chain</p>
<p class="body">We became top of the food chain, but along the way we developed these memories and that's why little kids are scared of monsters</p>
<p class="body">There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake</p>
<p class="body">He wrote about this</p>
<p class="body">He was on my podcast way way back in the day</p>
<p class="body">Really interesting guy</p>
<p class="body">But he he he wrote about this like this is the reason why these people have these memories and these fears</p>
<p class="body">It's like genetically driven</p>
<p class="body">That's the same thing with tribalism tosaint</p>
<p class="body">That's the thing that keeps us all from really connecting with each other to realize, like everybody, whether you're from Sweden or Africa or China or just</p>
<p class="body">The only thing that can separate us as communication or just if we all just figured out a away we where we can all like</p>
<p class="body">Look at things rationally and say there's no reason for us to ever shoot missiles at each other, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, this isn't yeah, this is where animals to try</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Nobody for animals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">US right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And kill imagine if like aliens were</p>
<p class="body">Invading like like Reagan</p>
<p class="body">Talked about that **** like the 1980s. How quickly we would abandon all of our issues with each other if the human race is being attacked by an alien race from another planet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, we alright? </p>
<p class="body">That wasn't a watchman, wouldn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like an alien like octopus thing like that came down and then the whole human race just like formed</p>
<p class="body">Together with Watchmen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What was that in? </p>
<p class="body">Oh, the Watchmen was that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<p class="body">But there it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, do you know that during the World War One that they stopped the fighting between the Germans and the Russians to fight off wolves? </p>
<p class="body">Wow, they made a truce</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">It was that</p>
<p class="body">But it was there was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That many walls so many guys they were fighting in like they were getting shot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's why all the cool</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They were leaving behind wounded people and the wounded people would get attacked by wolves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan0  </h4>
<p class="body">And so the wolves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Started figuring out that these battlegrounds they hear these bangs go off, that that meant that there was going to</p>
<p class="body">Be wounded people</p>
<p class="body">And somehow or another I don't know</p>
<p class="body">How wolves figure it out, but they come close to each other</p>
<p class="body">Soldiers on World War ones Eastern Front fought a common enemy wolves, so these people would get hurt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It was easy</p>
******* them up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And then these wolves would show up and just start</p>
<p class="body">They would get</p>
<p class="body">Eating these people alive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">He's like, **** that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Guy gets shot in the leg and can't run away, and a wolf just takes him down and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I'll tell you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Eat **** **** first</p>
<p class="body">That was real</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Youtube  </h4>
<p class="body">You did first</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
**** first **** first **** first on the battlefield</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Dale, that's a bad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Way to go</p>
<p class="body">So the military we need that huge military need just</p>
<p class="body">Like a pack of wolves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Dude, this but this is a real thing that happened like imagine how crazy it is the Russians and the Germans</p>
<p class="body">There's a article on Meat Eater about it because they kind of question like I had told this is Steve Rinella</p>
<p class="body">He's like what that's crazy and then it turns out it's true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Which is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I'm not 100% on those, I'm like I'm like 8 out of 10 on those</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes I got some stories that it's just straight up ********* but that one turned out to be real</p>
<p class="body">They really did have a ceasefire between the Nazis and the the the Germans and the Soviets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's, I mean, that's</p>
<p class="body">That's beautiful</p>
<p class="body">That's what I'm saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's wild shed the Russians and the the Germans decide</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Wolves, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I don't think it was the Nazis back then, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">No, they were</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Not not not CS sorry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Very German</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">My apologies</p>
<p class="body">The Germans and the Soviets in World War One and they they talked to each other and they said we gotta</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Fight these ******* wolves they had to do is send their beach down there to kiss all the ************ 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Though seemingly far fetched, it turns out these claims are mostly accurate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Women over men</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Historians even make little historians estimate that soldiers killed hundreds of wolves during the war, and that the surviving wolves fled to escape the carnage the like of which they had never encountered</p>
<p class="body">So this is just these soldiers decided for a brief moment</p>
<p class="body">Read this</p>
<p class="body">A kind of peace spread across the battlefield</p>
<p class="body">Even though gunshots and grenade grenade explosions continued to bring out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, you know I would have stopped that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So bit about the war</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Piece even though but but listen to this even though gunshots and grenade explosions are going off</p>
<p class="body">At least they don't have to</p>
<p class="body">Worry about wolves like they're</p>
<p class="body">They're comfortable that they can just fight people</p>
<p class="body">They have to fight</p>
<p class="body">These animals are going to eat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Them say so</p>
<p class="body">That would create peace</p>
<p class="body">Like OK yeah we're all humans we gotta kill these you know these other animals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">We gotta get these, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Here, that human nature takes back over again</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, then we'd</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah awful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's like what Ronald Reagan said</p>

<p class="body">Some wolves to the Ukraine and Russia</p>
<p class="body">Let's get a peace treaty</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, but wolves can't **** with the</p>
<p class="body">Guns we have now</p>

<p class="body">Right, it's just a</p>

<p class="body">As a child you know 'cause you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Can't afford or something like that and we're looking at this</p>
<p class="body">We don't really</p>
<p class="body">I mean I don't have any idea where they live, how removed they are from everybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, I mean there's there's tribes like that</p>
<p class="body">You're right</p>
<p class="body">And like in in middles of continents that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Youtube  </h4>
<p class="body">Come on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But this is way worse because it's like</p>
<p class="body">A very small</p>
<p class="body">Group of people that live in this one place and they're like known to be inbred, so like it's within our lifetimes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>

<p class="body">That is, the hills have eyes, then I'm straight</p>

<p class="body">They have a yoga class</p>
<p class="body">Oh gentle yoga, gentle yoga</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yolk with a bunch of ****** ******* Zombie substrate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That sounds that sounds relaxing trying to calm everybody down</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Youtube  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, I think like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">One of the best horror movies I ever saw was a bobcat Goldthwait</p>
<p class="body">Bobcat made a Bigfoot movie</p>
<p class="body">It's what is it called again</p>
<p class="body">Willow Creek it's about these guys who go up there to film this area where they first film Bigfoot and they get attacked by Bigfoot</p>
<p class="body">It talks about like all these people that are missing in the woods every year that go hiking and vanish. And it's like, yeah, it's like the Bigfoot's killing people</p>
<p class="body">But he did it like Blair Witch project style where it looks like you know some people, yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So there's these people that are hanging out, but it's ******* good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Man alright, Willow Creek</p>
<p class="body">I'm gonna check it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's good, it's good. It's the absolute best Bigfoot movie ever made. Hands down 100% Bobcat nailed it and bobcat is like a true believer</p>
<p class="body">He he and I have gone back and forth about Bigfoot on the podcast 'cause</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Next foot all I hear about is white people talking about Bigfoot, just running around, scaring people</p>
<p class="body">Do we ever kill anybody? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">No, no, not only do they never kill anybody in recorded history, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Hold on so this Bigfoot **** is a real</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Thing it was 100% of real animal. Well yes it was called Giganta Pittacus and they found during the 1920s at an apothecary shop in China, an anthropologist found a primate tooth that was far too big and he looked at it and he's like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">What what the **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What is this? </p>
<p class="body">This is bigger than a gorilla is like where did you get this? </p>
<p class="body">And they guided him to the area where it was excavated and they found a bunch of different bones</p>
<p class="body">And jawbones that represented a by peedle hominid that was approximately 8 to 10 feet tall</p>
<p class="body">So this was a real animal that lived in Asia</p>
<p class="body">And we know that humans walked across the Bering Strait into</p>
<p class="body">That's what it looked like</p>
<p class="body">OK, so humans walked across the Bering Strait</p>
<p class="body">They believed the Bering land mass into</p>
<p class="body">North America 
<p class="body">And they think that short faced bears</p>
<p class="body">And a bunch of other animals made it through that area too, but they think there's a remote possibility that this giant primate from Asia at one point in time thousands of years ago, interacted with people and that people have this</p>
<p class="body">Go back to that image again</p>
<p class="body">They just had Jamie so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Not a bear, it's a</p>
<p class="body">Primate, a primate. It's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's, uh, primates, a giant primate that's in like the that that give me that large so</p>
<p class="body">It's in a</p>
<p class="body">It's a giant primate in the orangutan family</p>
<p class="body">They believe, right? </p>
<p class="body">So what they have is like a few jawbone pieces and a bunch of different things that</p>
<p class="body">So they verified that it's a real animal, so that's why they have this chart here</p>
<p class="body">It's a gigantic pithecus</p>
<p class="body">Blackie is the official like Latin name for it and this ******* thing is how big is it? </p>
3.5 meters OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Bigger than two</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But it's bigger than Shaq, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So that's at least 7 feet tall, so it's somewhere around 7 feet, no three 3.5 meters is 9 feet, 10 feet tall. 10 feet, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Young Jamie  </h4>
<p class="body">It's like 10 fill</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And so this giant thing was a real animal that existed that lived with people. So these these bones that they found, I'm I'm. I think they were like 100,000 years old</p>
<p class="body">CCS, you can find that Giganta pittacus bones aged so they found them and they realized that these animals were living alongside with people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">The **** people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It could have been he</p>
<p class="body">Did whatever the **** he</p>
<p class="body">Wanted I mean if he came upon your village</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
10 foot tall 
<p class="body">He shoot, what're you gonna do? </p>
<p class="body">The rim</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, what do you? </p>
<p class="body">What are you gonna? </p>
<p class="body">Do you gonna stop him? </p>
<p class="body">I'm gonna stop from ******* you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">They had a male video and stuff before they had</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You go stop</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">It should</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">They had a male Bigfoot</p>
<p class="body">They had to have a female Bigfoot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They definitely did, but so the idea is that this is what like was the thing that Native Americans talk about in their folklore</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Because there's, I think there's 100 different Native American names for Sasquatch. They they have a bunch of different names for them, which leads a lot of these people who study these cultures</p>
<p class="body">You go man</p>
<p class="body">That is very unusual</p>
<p class="body">It's very unusual that they talk about a thing that's not real over and over and over and over and over again</p>
<p class="body">And if you know that this used to be a real thing, which Giganta Pittacus definitely was, and then you know that these Native Americans, everything else, whether it's the Buffalo, whether it's the pronghorn or the deer, all those things they</p>
<p class="body">The bear they they had them all mapped out</p>
<p class="body">They talked about all of it and like they were very accurate about where they lived and how they traveled and how to hunt them</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but then they had this Sasquatch thing</p>
<p class="body">Well, what the **** is that right? </p>
<p class="body">What is? </p>
<p class="body">That how do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It's just extinct, I'm saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But how do you know that that wasn't real? How do you know that that like 30,000 years ago 40,000 years ago? These people? </p>
<p class="body">Had countered these things</p>
<p class="body">And imagine you're a ******* dude with a bow and arrow</p>
<p class="body">You're trying to feed your babies and you're sneaking through the forest and you see a 10 foot orangutan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Just a giant thing looking at you and you're</p>
<p class="body">Like yeah, and they just didn't make it</p>
<p class="body">It too tall, too tall</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">He killed him all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, they killed him off</p>
<p class="body">Or maybe they didn't have enough food</p>
<p class="body">Or maybe there's predators</p>
<p class="body">Who knows what the **** it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But like if if something dies for whatever whatever reason, if something like dies off like woolly mammoth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, maybe the yeah, like once there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, they're not here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Well you know thing with their life span too, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Anymore they got killed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Because even tall humans right like their life span is shorter</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, and also like the amount of food they must need</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So that could be it too</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">If you're 10 feet tall, the amount of ******* food you must need</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Like a two year lifespan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Or something, Oh my God</p>
<p class="body">And if you don't figure out weapons before the people do and they have catapults</p>
<p class="body">And **** yeah</p>
<p class="body">I mean, who knows with all that David and Goliath **** Who knows? </p>
<p class="body">But like a</p>
<p class="body">Who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Bones not a lot of bones, huh? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Who knows if and? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, the David and Goliath</p>
<p class="body">Oh bro, we talked about this a couple weeks ago with David and Goliath, like about how that's genocide</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What if that was about a Bigfoot? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Which is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">What David did, he fought this big dude one and they said</p>
<p class="body">All right, no kill all of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh, is that? </p>
<p class="body">What he did wait a minute after he killed Goliath killed? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Everybody yeah, killed all the big negah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">No, it was</p>
<p class="body">It was that whole people, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that that is that that that is open genocide the</p>
<p class="body">David Ladd story</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, that's unfortunate and not productive to the narrative, so I'd appreciate if you leave</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right, and I don't want</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to talk about King David that way</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to get attacked by the media</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Change go change your digital life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And then we're</p>
<p class="body">Gonna make rules</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah I need</p>
<p class="body">Off switch, but yeah I need some diverse counseling after this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Imagine if you had a metaverse where you you were on a beach and you were waiting on the beach watching a group of Vikings pull their boats up to the shore and you're like **** and flaming arrows start flying through the air as they reach the shore and you realize they're going to rape and kill everybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">And that was</p>
<p class="body">A reality of history and your trust in the Metaverse</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">In the middle of it I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Because you hear that and there's a bunch of dudes saying like you know you love it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Trying to survive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, imagine like a bunch of dudes like who make their avatars KKK and being like, oh come here, you know, like start start black dragon you or start lynching in the metaverse</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's the meta first though I don't</p>
<p class="body">Give a **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I see you don't give a **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But The thing is, but if the metaverse becomes more compelling than the regular world and you spend most of your time there, what is real life? </p>
<p class="body">Here's the question. If you have 24 hours in real life, but you spend 15 of it in the metaverse, isn't that more real life than real life? </p>
<p class="body">If all you do that, you'll get a couple of things done and you go to sleep for the rest of the time</p>
<p class="body">But if life becomes so much more interesting</p>
<p class="body">In this digital world, right people are gonna try</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">It see we might be in a month looking metaverse right there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">That's the question</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It's always true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">We might be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">But I think you're right, though I think, yeah, you know my niece, his kids, your kids, kind of a thing that they're going to grow up and then like the</p>
<p class="body">What the 2014, 2015? If they're still around or? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">There's some kind</p>
<p class="body">Of a war that kills the power grid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Either one of those things is real, like if you learn anything from this whole Ukraine situation, learn that it can happen, right? </p>
<p class="body">Learn that a war is a real possibility and all this all this jargon people like to pretend they know what the **** is going on or what's important</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's the terrifying part</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">What's more that Friday</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Hell yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">All these people that pretend they know what the **** is going on</p>
<p class="body">They don't</p>
<p class="body">Nobody does</p>
<p class="body">This is kind of chaotic in terms of like what's going to happen I</p>
<p class="body">Mean you know where? </p>
<p class="body">Where this is going to go? </p>
<p class="body">This is ******* chaotic man</p>

<p class="body">This isn't just talk and there's a lot of like just crazy talk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">People talk about foreign policy and what's important</p>
<p class="body">And then when you watch missiles</p>
<p class="body">Hit apartment buildings</p>
<p class="body">You're like</p>
<p class="body">Holy **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, it's too late</p>
<p class="body">I'm the misinformation king, but I'm uncredible</p>
<p class="body">Listen to me, don't listen to me</p>
<p class="body">That's what you should listen if you want to listen to me</p>

<p class="body">Nobody talks about</p>
<p class="body">You know what? </p>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">One of the things I did when I got cancelled and I started doing mushrooms mushrooms every day for like three or four days and one thing</p>
<p class="body">The mushrooms told me one time said you're not a bad person but you left a bad impression</p>
<p class="body">And I was like</p>
<p class="body">Whoa, that's a wild statement when you get a statement like this</p>
<p class="body">Times when I do mushrooms when I</p>
<p class="body">Get these like little</p>
<p class="body">I get these</p>
<p class="body">Little moments where I come in I'm I'm just imagining I'm talking to something or something really talking</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, what is this like what is this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">As here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Is this like my own imagination trying to like sort out my existence? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">We called that the Jiminy cricket right</p>
<p class="body">Negative cricket negative cricket that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's hilarious</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">So far, yeah, but you also, I mean listen the God Slayer is tough</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's hilarious</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's rough</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">The God of all slurs is a tough one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's the rough one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause other ones</p>
<p class="body">I mean like you know, there's like with the C word you know there's so many factions of that were right in the in the English language, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">The feet were cocaine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">And even if</p>
<p class="body">You say, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's a bunch of great bits about that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That word too that you know The thing is like where I can't wait and I've said this on stage too that I can't wait until we can read minds</p>
<p class="body">Because then, like what we're trying to do, is like interpret a very specific and terrible meaning for anything that a person says</p>
<p class="body">But whether it's you know what whatever slur is where it can, or the N word, the F word or whatever</p>
<p class="body">But what words it's supposed to be is a person conveying their intent or so</p>
<p class="body">If there comes a time</p>
<p class="body">Or we can read each other's minds</p>
<p class="body">We can understand how you really feel</p>
<p class="body">We're just not we we're we're basically going on like weird roadside maps, right? </p>
<p class="body">We're not going on 100% understanding of how a person is trying to communicate and why, and where they're coming from</p>
<p class="body">So we base it on words, which is perfect</p>
<p class="body">It's beautiful</p>
<p class="body">It's amazing, it's eloquent</p>
<p class="body">It's the best way we have to communicate</p>
<p class="body">I'm not knocking it, but what I'm saying is there's going to come a time in our lifetime where we don't have to do that anymore</p>
<p class="body">What we're going to be able to communicate with each other just by virtue of your intent and how you feel right? </p>
<p class="body">And we instead of like being it wrapped up in different languages and sounds people make, like Germans, make a very different sound than Koreans who make a very different sound than Brazilians</p>
<p class="body">Like everybody got their own way</p>
<p class="body">The sound, the flavor</p>
<p class="body">But all they're trying to do is let you know how they think</p>
<p class="body">That's all I'm trying to do right now too, and one of the benefits that I have of all this crazy **** going on is I have a podcast, yeah, and then people have heard me talk so many ******* times</p>
<p class="body">They kind of understand who I am or</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, we know you are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">When style Bender said that at a press conference, I legitimately teared up</p>
<p class="body">Oh legitimately, teared up 'cause</p>
<p class="body">I love that dude and he said that I was like goddamnit, he's amazing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">My dog</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">So you could fit man, you know what? </p>
<p class="body">As as as a as a black man in America, I could feel the energy of racism when anybody I go around</p>
<p class="body">I I kind of know if you were racist I could just spend 5 minutes with you and be like Oh yeah, this ****** ****** don't like me either because I'm black or I could be, you know have more money than him</p>
<p class="body">Or maybe it could be something like that, but I could</p>
<p class="body">I could feel the energy</p>
<p class="body">From like people who raised, you know, just how how you you know what you how you talk to things you say you know what I mean like I know and you know we all got our own prejudices</p>
<p class="body">You know I'm saying this **** that we don't understand about each other culture man, so I mean that's just that's just comes with just being different manner but racist</p>
<p class="body">I could</p>
<p class="body">I could smell that I can feel that I know when a ****** ****** is like</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't **** with you</p>
<p class="body">You know, I'm saying like it, it's it's obvious it stands out it, you know, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's talk about the real heroes</p>
<p class="body">Let's talk about</p>
<p class="body">The interracial interracial **** male talent right you Mr</p>
<p class="body">Martin says Lexington Steele we don't say it enough during Black History Month, how? </p>

<p class="body">I just love those cats</p>
<p class="body">Yeah man it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">It's an interesting time for people to figure out what the **** is important to be upset about and what not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, at this day and age like how how can you hate black people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You can't say how can</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Can you hate sexing people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">You hate gay people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Just right, heck, you hate anybody</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah hey nobody man like what the **** like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But the problem is Moses, you can attest this</p>
<p class="body">One of our problems as comedians is we</p>
<p class="body">The fun is in talking **** exactly and the fun is in trying to push a boundary or say something you think might be funny and you got like a split second to press the green light and you're like, let's run with this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's see how this goes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That's the game, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's see</p>
<p class="body">And when you're on stage, that's the number one thing like the the</p>
<p class="body">Mistakes that you make on stage</p>
<p class="body">You go down the road and you're</p>
<p class="body">Like Oh my God</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">This is hate speech, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I can't believe I'm even here</p>
<p class="body">It's like you don't meet you just trying to you trying to remove yourself from the equation long enough to find a path that's funny</p>
<p class="body">But along the way you're going to say some ridiculous **** They probably would rather have edited</p>
<p class="body">You'd rather have started from scratch</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Like I used to, I used to work</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">That was the racist **** right? </p>
<p class="body">That right? </p>
<p class="body">That was that he would like he</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah you would</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">He felt that you could feel</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">It I was working with comedy Store</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">He was he was trying to make them feel bad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I feel bad</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, they woman called</p>
<p class="body">I was working the phones</p>
<p class="body">I mean I said the story actually on this</p>
<p class="body">Podcast but</p>
<p class="body">He did a bit and then it's race related</p>
<p class="body">Obviously black on the calls</p>
<p class="body">Next day I'm working the phone</p>
<p class="body">She's just like I just had to let you know there's a comedian you guys have named Brian Moses and he was doing a joke</p>
<p class="body">And it was about black people and the black people weren't really laughing, but the whites were kind of laughing a little bit and I just wanna let you know like he</p>
<p class="body">He can start a race</p>
<p class="body">Right in your club</p>
<p class="body">Wow, you answered the funding</p>
<p class="body">I the phone bro</p>
<p class="body">And she said he's gonna start a raise</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">He gets so race riots</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right I was</p>
<p class="body">Like I'm black and I did a joke like what are we talking about here? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Oh my</p>
<p class="body">God, it's so funny</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Just because it had to do with you know it was about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">But you know what's here's what's fascinating about this whole conversation</p>
<p class="body">Is that the socially it balances out where people understand what you can and can't talk about? </p>
<p class="body">And that's the that's the recognition of the history of racism in this country</p>
<p class="body">Is that a person like me? </p>
<p class="body">Can't say the N word? </p>
<p class="body">It's impossible</p>
<p class="body">You can't say it</p>
<p class="body">You can't say it anymore</p>
<p class="body">If you say it, people gonna get furious at you, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's an emotional thing</p>
<p class="body">Well, why is that? </p>
<p class="body">It's only possible if there's a disproportionate</p>
<p class="body">Like if there was a word, it doesn't make any sense</p>
<p class="body">If there's not a disproportionate history like this is a thing that I think we all have to like recognize all of us is like this</p>
<p class="body">There's a</p>
<p class="body">An imbalance that hasn't been rectified absolutely like people get scared of that word reparations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Right absolutely</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Like what does that mean? </p>
<p class="body">This is what here's what everybody has to do</p>
<p class="body">You have to find all the spots that got ****** by the Civil War and by slavery you got to fix that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Gotta fix</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">That **** Well, the problem is they already gave reparations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Should fix fix</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Remember that I mean like, yeah, they gave all the slave owners the money</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, because they lost the property</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Hold that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">So what right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Nobody says this right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">That's a real thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean like like with us? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean they they they definitely did that they reimbursed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, they they</p>
<p class="body">They gave us slave owners because they lost all their property</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yes, yes they reimbursed them</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if it was like, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">They called reparations if</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">You gave black people like</p>
<p class="body">A tax break like we ain't gotta pay taxes or or</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">I guess what I'm saying for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Years we should</p>
<p class="body">We should not pay taxes at</p>
<p class="body">All we shouldn't have to pay taxes</p>
<p class="body">We should give free property</p>
<p class="body">You know what I'm saying? </p>
<p class="body">Like I mean that that's free tuition</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Free tuition</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">They gave Native Americans casinos</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, you gotta</p>
<p class="body">You gotta economically help</p>
<p class="body">Help help help us</p>
<p class="body">Catch up, you know I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, here's the thing that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Saying and that's and that's the problem with it is economics</p>
<p class="body">We don't, we don't control anything</p>
<p class="body">We don't control property</p>
<p class="body">We won't control the food coming in our community</p>
<p class="body">We don't control our community well whenever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, whenever you have a spot that's stuck whenever, whenever you have a spot that's like socially compromised, like, uh, financially compromised, like there's meaning socially compromised</p>
<p class="body">Meaning there's like gang violence and drug abuse, and there's a lot of stuff around them, and it's been like that for decades</p>
<p class="body">And if they don't step in</p>
<p class="body">Then this that's bad management</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Well, you could dwindle that down if Negers had farms and NGZ said, you know, I'm saying factories and things where we generated are all things we gotta go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">You know, but we're we have more black millionaires than we've ever had in the history of of black people</p>
<p class="body">We have the most educated people now, like women in the history of black people</p>
<p class="body">So I'm saying why aren't we doing that now? </p>
'cause they were doing that back with the Black Panthers and everybody like this so we could we could be doing that now we could be buying property in neighborhoods</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">We could we could be turning this **** around</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's not something that's instantaneously solved, but it it is something that people are more and more aware of and they they just all the communication</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">And that's facts, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Let's people like think about it more and more, and then we come to a better place than where we were a week ago</p>
<p class="body">A year ago, whatever and that that's where we are with like basically every cultural issue</p>
<p class="body">That's why you can watch that video of</p>
<p class="body">Al Jolson from 100 years ago. And you can't even believe it's real. 'cause we're making progress. We're making progress as human beings, and the only way the only thing that stops that progress is anything that stops communication</p>
<p class="body">So when you stop communication, you stop discussion, you stop, you stop, people try to figure from trying to figure out like what's good and what's bad and what makes people feel bad and why it does that and</p>
<p class="body">Like why is this word more potent than that word? </p>
<p class="body">And you know discussion</p>
<p class="body">It's ******* gigantically important</p>
<p class="body">That's why it's terrifying that there's people in this day and age that wanna stop discussion</p>
<p class="body">They shouldn't stop discussion</p>
<p class="body">You should have have your own response to whatever that discussion is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Talk about it, disagree</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Freddie Gibbs  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Robustly disagree, but don't stop discussion right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Don't stop Freddie Gibbs from ******* up to Bill Maher podcast 'cause you know he did</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">Brian Moses Roast Battle is one of the most important</p>
<p class="body">There's two important shows in live standup comedy in the United States today</p>
<p class="body">One of them is roast battle, the other ones killed Tony</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
<p class="body">I, I firmly, I firmly believe that one two punch is critical for the development of up and coming talent</p>
<p class="body">They learn how to **** with each other and they learn how to take a joke and learn how to be like a little bit selfless with it and roast, battle and then I kill Tony</p>
<p class="body">They learn how to do one minute under high pressure in front of the whole ******* world and both of them are super critical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Brian Moses  </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, exactly</p>
<p class="body">Thank you bro</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> @Joe Rogan  </h4>
