<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">First of all, thanks for coming and</p>
<p class="body">Very nice time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Thanks Christmas present</p>
<p class="body">Actually, Ryan Cole is the one that first got these, and my wife has been jealous ever since, so this is what</p>
<p class="body">I got for where? </p>
<p class="body">Previous list</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Does one get a COVID tie? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">She looked it up on on Amazon or someplace and found it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You gotta love how industrious some of these</p>
<p class="body">Folks are, that's just</p>
<p class="body">You know they they find a niche like I know what I want to sell COVID ties</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">There you go</p>
<p class="body">I gotta I gotta have a tux for an event that's coming up in Texas in a couple of months</p>
<p class="body">And so my wife is writing to the guy that does the ties and to see if he can make a bow tie</p>
<p class="body">That's got the virus on it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Are you? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, are you tired of this? </p>
<p class="body">Tired dealing with this, do you feel a duty to talk about this like we should just say because of historically we should just state what's happening here</p>
<p class="body">So today is the 20</p>
<p class="body">Know the 30th of December and yesterday you were kicked off Twitter correct, true? </p>
<p class="body">Uhm, we scheduled this in advance</p>
<p class="body">It's just coincidentally that you were kicked off Twitter</p>
<p class="body">What, what were you kicked out? </p>
<p class="body">Well, first of all, before we even do this, please tell everybody what your history is and what your 
<p class="body">What your degrees are and what you do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK so I'm gonna do the short version</p>
<p class="body">OK so you know this can last for an hour if we go into the whole history of M RNA vaccines and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p class="body">My history I I am</p>
<p class="body">I was originally a Carpenter and a farmhand in the Central Coast of California, and decided that I wanted</p>
<p class="body">To go back to</p>
<p class="body">School and did two years of computer science and then decided that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life looking at a computer monitor in a basement</p>
<p class="body">Bad decision and decided that I wanted to try to become an MD</p>
<p class="body">Which was a hard thing to try to do in the in the late 70s, so that was a real stretch objective</p>
<p class="body">Went to UC Davis after two years of undergrad at Santa Barbara City College</p>
<p class="body">And wanted to work on this new tech space called molecular biology, in particular on cancer</p>
<p class="body">My mother was deathly afraid of breast cancer and so I looked around and found a laboratory UC Davis with a guy named Bob Cardiff and another guy named Mary Gardner</p>
<p class="body">That were working with retroviruses and their links to breast cancer</p>
<p class="body">And it just happened that while I was in there, this is circa 8384</p>
<p class="body">This whole thing cut loose in San Francisco with the immunodeficiency syndrome in men, and the lab ended up right at the forefront of that, you know, Davis is just down the street, basically from San Francisco</p>
<p class="body">And at the Davis Primate Center, they had discovered that there were monkeys that had immunodeficiency</p>
<p class="body">And so I was there in the lab as an undergraduate as a total bench rat</p>
<p class="body">When Preston Marx and Murray Gardner and others made the first discovery of a retrovirus basis for immunodeficiency in primates</p>
<p class="body">Then Murray went to the pastor</p>
<p class="body">Brought back the virus literally</p>
<p class="body">In his pocket</p>
<p class="body">Went with there with Bob Gallo</p>
<p class="body">Met with a guy named Luc Montagnier that you may know</p>
<p class="body">And that kind of kicked off the whole vaccine effort for AIDS, so I that's kind of what I cut my teeth on</p>
<p class="body">So it came out of that I, you know, I was</p>
<p class="body">It was it was really bold to think that I could get into medical school</p>
<p class="body">And I kind of overshot the mark</p>
<p class="body">I got an MD PhD Scholarship at Northwestern University in Chicago, and so I went from having grown up in Santa Barbara with my wife</p>
<p class="body">We were high school sweethearts to Chicago and that was kind of an abrupt</p>
<p class="body">Transition so</p>
<p class="body">We decided that I would do my graduate work at San Diego</p>
<p class="body">And I've been accepted into a program</p>
<p class="body">At UC San Diego that had two of the top gene therapy specialists, I really wanted to do gene therapy with retroviruses</p>
<p class="body">That was what I thought was going to be my life</p>
<p class="body">And so we moved down to San Diego and I started working in the laboratory vendor Virma, which is in the</p>
<p class="body">Molecular biology and virology labs at the Salk Institute</p>
<p class="body">And this is a place where graduate students normally aren't allowed to go</p>
<p class="body">It was there was seven Nobel laureates at the time, plus Jonas, A really intense competitive environment</p>
<p class="body">I carved out a little niche that I was going to work on for my graduate work, which was asking questions about how retrovirus RNA is packaged</p>
<p class="body">And from that</p>
<p class="body">I had to develop a series of technologies to manufacture RNA and structure it and eventually put it into cells and that through a cascade of events being at the right place at the right time, asking the right questions, surrounded by geniuses</p>
<p class="body">Led to the series of discoveries that now forms the basis</p>
<p class="body">Of the RNA technology platform that gives rise to these vaccines</p>
<p class="body">And 10 issued patents from there were all filed in 89</p>
<p class="body">So that's kind of my origin story that it relates to this virus and vaccine and this, but since then</p>
<p class="body">Went on finished my MD did two fellowships at UC Davis</p>
<p class="body">Taught pathology for years</p>
<p class="body">Set up a gene therapy lab</p>
<p class="body">Had many other discoveries</p>
<p class="body">Came out to the East Coast</p>
<p class="body">Created the technology platform that is now the basis of the company called Inovio</p>
<p class="body">We actually originally founded Inovio</p>
<p class="body">In the United States, this is a post electrical fields</p>
<p class="body">They have one of the DNA vaccines for COVID</p>
<p class="body">Then the planes hit the towers</p>
<p class="body">The investors pulled back and I went to work for a company called Dyne Port Vaccine Company that had the prime systems contract as government speak for all the biodefense products for the Department of Defense for Advanced Development, which is to say clinical trials through licensure</p>
<p class="body">And that's why I kind of transition from being an academic</p>
<p class="body">To focusing on actually making things that work in people</p>
<p class="body">And the big epiphany there was that the world is full of these academic thought leaders that publish in big journals and stuff</p>
<p class="body">But that doesn't really lead to products</p>
<p class="body">And I really wanted to make products that would help people</p>
<p class="body">And so since then, for the last, I guess it's about 20 years</p>
<p class="body">I've been focused on actually doing stuff, regulatory affairs, clinical development, getting the necessary training, et cetera completed a fellowship at Harvard University Medical School</p>
<p class="body">I'm global as a global clinical scholar to round out my CV and I've run, you know, over 100 clinical trials</p>
<p class="body">Mostly in the vaccine space</p>
<p class="body">But also in drug repurposing I've been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS</p>
<p class="body">This is kind of what I do</p>
<p class="body">I've worn literally billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts. I'm often brought in by NIH to serve as a study section chair for awarding, you know, 80 to $120 million contracts in vaccines and biodefense</p>
<p class="body">I've spent countless hours at the CDC at the ACP ACIP meetings</p>
<p class="body">I have multiple friends at the CDC</p>
<p class="body">I work closely with defense Threat Reduction Agency, which is A and it's one of my favorite clients partners teaming partners</p>
<p class="body">And I work with the Kembai defense group</p>
<p class="body">There's other branches</p>
<p class="body">Including the other, this is not the branch that funded the Wuhan Labs</p>
<p class="body">That's another branch of detra</p>
<p class="body">I've got many friends in the intelligence community</p>
<p class="body">So I'm I'm kind of a pretty deep insider in terms of the government</p>
<p class="body">I'm kind of a pretty deep insider in terms of the government</p>
<p class="body">I know Tony Fauci</p>
<p class="body">Personally, I've dealt with him my whole career</p>
<p class="body">And then</p>
<p class="body">We had this particular outbreak and I was tip of the spear on bringing the Ebola vaccine forward that we now call the Merc Ebola vaccine</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm the one that got Merck involved</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now when the pandemic broke out previous to that, I mean you're you're kind of thought of as a heretic</p>
<p class="body">Now in some strange way</p>
<p class="body">And yeah, yeah, Pariah is probably a better word</p>
<p class="body">And the fact that you've been banned from Twitter is it's</p>
<p class="body">It's very confusing because I've been following your tweets and I've been reading all the things you've written and</p>
<p class="body">I don't understand how it justifies a ban and I don't know what was the particular tweet</p>
<p class="body">Did did they tell you what the particular tweet was or what the offense was that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">They never tell</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You they never told you, they just tell anybody they removed you for not going along with whatever the tech narrative is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, never</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause tech clearly has a censorship agenda when it comes to COVID in terms of treatment in terms of the whether or not you are promoting what they would call vaccine hesitancy</p>
<p class="body">They can ban you for that</p>
<p class="body">They can ban you for in their eyes what they think is a justifiable offense, and they're doing this</p>
<p class="body">And I don't know who these people are that are doing this, but they're doing these</p>
<p class="body">This one of the most important things about you reading out your history like that is to one of the most qualified people in the world to talk about vaccines</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, thank you for that</p>
<p class="body">I I think that that's so one way that some people put it is in</p>
<p class="body">Of course, since this has happened, I've been contacted by multiple lawyers</p>
<p class="body">That are looking at filing a suit</p>
<p class="body">Just like Alex Berenson has won against Twitter</p>
<p class="body">Come in and the point is made just what you just made</p>
<p class="body">If so, the point that I, I think is kind of succinct on this is</p>
<p class="body">If my voice if it if there's no merit to my voice being in the conversation, whether it's true or not, whether I'm factually correct or not, let's park that just for a minute</p>
<p class="body">Whether or not I'm right in everything I say, and I freely admit no one is perfect</p>
<p class="body">I'm not perfect</p>
<p class="body">It's one of my core points</p>
<p class="body">Is people should think for themselves and I try really hard to give people the information</p>
<p class="body">And help them to think not to tell them what to think</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">The point is, if if I'm not, if if it's not OK for me to be part of the conversation even though I'm pointing out scientific facts that may be inconvenient</p>
<p class="body">Then who is who can be allowed? </p>
<p class="body">And whether you're in the camp that says I'm a liar and I didn't invent this technology despite the patents</p>
<p class="body">And there's a whole cohort of that</p>
<p class="body">No one can debate that dispute that I played a major role in the creation of this tech and virtually all other voices that have that background</p>
<p class="body">I have conflicts of interest, financial conflicts of interest</p>
<p class="body">I think I'm the only one that doesn't</p>
<p class="body">I'm not getting any</p>
<p class="body">Money out of this</p>
<p class="body">I think that it starts to touch on some fundamental constitutional principles about rights of free speech</p>
<p class="body">I suspect that's kind of where you're going on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That well, most certainly, but also</p>
<p class="body">How disturbing it is for someone who's not an academic like myself to watch people like you get silenced and silenced in this platform? </p>
<p class="body">Of social media where people are exchanging information they're posting up</p>
<p class="body">Studies and you're you're discussing different parts of this pandemic that are in the news and what what the issues may lie in and where your background and your expertise allows you to explain this in a way that maybe it's not being explained because of the the narrative that's being discussed in the mainstream news and to watch you get</p>
<p class="body">Silenced first of all, to watch you get ostracized</p>
<p class="body">I've I've seen that I've seen people distance themselves from you</p>
<p class="body">I've seen people</p>
<p class="body">Call you a crazy person and criticize you, but with no specific thing to point to</p>
<p class="body">It became like A tag they put on you like oh that guy</p>
<p class="body">Like I I brought you up to someone and he goes</p>
<p class="body">Oh that guy is crazy I go how so there was no answer</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's like OK, so this is a thing you're going to just say someone is crazy when they say something that's inconvenient or say something that makes you uncomfortable because you've decided to accept a certain narrative</p>
<p class="body">Did Twitter warn you, know, was there any tweets where they said that this is misleading? </p>
<p class="body">Or anything no no</p>
<p class="body">Do you have any idea what the final tweet was or what within context was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I think I do</p>
<p class="body">I think I do, and there's no way to confirm it until the lawyers you know do their lawyering</p>
<p class="body">Now I did have in the case of when I was banned from LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">Remember this happened</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I wasn't aware of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I was deep platform from LinkedIn many months ago and it was</p>
<p class="body">There was actually two events of of deep platforming in LinkedIn, and in both cases I was able to get an explanation for what the specific crimes were</p>
<p class="body">They thought crimes</p>
<p class="body">And in the first one it was a tweet</p>
<p class="body">A LinkedIn posting in which I pointed out that the chairman of the board of Thomson Reuters also sits on the board of Pfizer</p>
<p class="body">And and I simply wrote is, does this look like a conflict of interest to you? </p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">And this gets to your core question about tech</p>
<p class="body">It's not tech</p>
<p class="body">It's it's the horizontal integration across all major industries now under the control of common funds</p>
<p class="body">All of these industries, the the harmonization of the tech censorship, the interests of pharma, big media, et cetera and governments all being harmonized in their messaging</p>
<p class="body">Globally, I mean I travel a lot</p>
<p class="body">OK, I see the same and I have physicians coming to me all the time about what they're experiencing</p>
<p class="body">The same playbook is going on every continent</p>
<p class="body">But getting back to LinkedIn so</p>
<p class="body">This is this is the first event and Steve Kirsch intervened</p>
<p class="body">It called up a vice president, LinkedIn and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Steve Kirsch is a tech guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah he is</p>
<p class="body">He's a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who you may or may not recall that I was on the Brett Weinstein Dark Horse Podcast with Steve to kind of lit this whole fire up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Months and months, that's right</p>
<p class="body">OK, that's where I first</p>
<p class="body">Saw him OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so so he he has great network connections in Silicon Valley</p>
<p class="body">He invented the optical mouse</p>
<p class="body">And so he he called this vice president LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">The guy looked into it</p>
<p class="body">Meanwhile, people started dropping off of LinkedIn in protest and there was major press articles all over the world</p>
<p class="body">And then they reinstated me and I actually got a very kind letter</p>
<p class="body">This is unprecedented personal letter from this Vice president apologizing and saying in saying specifically that they didn't have the talent</p>
<p class="body">To Fact Check me</p>
<p class="body">And then therefore they were going to let me go</p>
<p class="body">Now then subsequently I got dropped again</p>
<p class="body">And phone call was made and they got put on</p>
<p class="body">In that case the SYN was that some one of their fact checkers because remember this is Microsoft</p>
<p class="body">One of their fact Checkers had identified the Atlantic Monthly article attack articles written about me and concluded that I was an antivaxxer and therefore I should not be allowed on LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">Now the context for that that's fascinating is that Atlantic monthly attack article that is often cited by my detractors</p>
<p class="body">And it's a fascinating read</p>
<p class="body">We could go down that rabbit hole, but no reason</p>
<p class="body">It was written a few days after Peter Navarro and I came out with an Op Ed in The Washington Times in which we criticized Biden policy on vaccines and said that they should be reserved for those that need the most and not used universally</p>
<p class="body">And we said some other things about the need of of testing and tools so that people can assess their true risk</p>
<p class="body">It was a political retaliation intended to take me off the map as I was starting to interact more of a public policy sphere</p>
<p class="body">Now with this this Twitter event</p>
<p class="body">My wife and I were have wracked our brains about what was the what is likely to have been the tweet that triggered this, and you know, you never know</p>
<p class="body">The last two that I can think of that went out was one that was on our sub stack in which we referred to a fantastic video that has been put out by the Canadian COVID Care clients group that summarizes all the malfeasance and data manipulation and misinterpretation associated with the Pfizer vaccines</p>
<p class="body">And their clinical trials</p>
<p class="body">It's a super video</p>
<p class="body">And of course, that's I guess that is interpreted as something that would cause people to</p>
<p class="body">Become vaccine hesitant</p>
<p class="body">That's the sin in general</p>
<p class="body">Is saying things that cause people to become vaccine hesitant? </p>
<p class="body">The other thing that I put out immediately before that was a post a link</p>
<p class="body">To a website for the World Economic Forum that lays out their entire strategy for how they manage media, how they're managing COVID-19, and all of their core messaging. It's a fascinating website with links</p>
<p class="body">Those are the only two things I can think of that would meet the criteria</p>
<p class="body">So you know my position all the way through</p>
<p class="body">This comes off of the platform of bioethics and the importance of informed consent</p>
<p class="body">So my position is that people should have the freedom to choice of choice, particularly for their children</p>
<p class="body">And that in order to</p>
<p class="body">To appropriately choose to participate in a medical experiment, they have to be fully informed of the risks</p>
<p class="body">As well as the benefits</p>
<p class="body">And so I've tried really hard to make sure that people have access to the information</p>
<p class="body">About those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, et cetera</p>
<p class="body">And the policy that's being implemented is 1 in which no discussion of the risks are allowed</p>
<p class="body">Because by definition they will elicit vaccine hesitancy</p>
<p class="body">So it can't be discussed, but that's the fundamental background</p>
<p class="body">That's the backbone of informed consent so informed consent is not only not happening, it's being actively blocked</p>
<p class="body">That makes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sense it does make sense, and it's unprecedented</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I I can't recall a time ever where people weren't able to discuss</p>
<p class="body">Side effects of medication, whether or not the studies are accurate, whether or not people should universally take these things, or whether it should be done on a person by person basis</p>
<p class="body">This is a</p>
<p class="body">It's a very strange time, and so when someone who's an expert like yourself has</p>
<p class="body">A dissenting opinion and you see that dissenting opinion immediately silenced or or at least immediately criticized</p>
<p class="body">And then these attempts at silencing it</p>
<p class="body">It just it just signifies how confusing and how troubled the times were in our</p>
<p class="body">When COVID first hit when the lockdown started happening in March of 2020, what was your position on all this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So you're kind of asking my origin story with COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, I mean were you initially? </p>
<p class="body">Do you have? </p>
<p class="body">Have you taken the COVID vaccine? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So the answer is yes</p>
<p class="body">I've also been infected twice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">After you took it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Once before I was infected at the end of February because I was attending a MIT Conference on Drug Discovery and artificial intelligence so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is pre lockdown February 20</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">But it goes back further than that</p>
<p class="body">There's a CIA agent that I've Co published with in the past named Michael Callahan</p>
<p class="body">He was in Wuhan in the fourth quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th</p>
<p class="body">I was currently managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organophosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents</p>
<p class="body">For Ditra defense, Threat Reduction agency involving high, high performing computing and bio robot screening, high end stuff, and he told me Robert, you got to get your team spun up because we got a problem with this new virus</p>
<p class="body">I've worked with him through prayer outbreaks</p>
<p class="body">So it was then that I turned my attention to this</p>
<p class="body">Started modeling</p>
<p class="body">A key protein, a protease inhibitor</p>
<p class="body">Of this virus, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the Wuhan seafood market virus</p>
<p class="body">And I've been pretty much going on stop ever since</p>
<p class="body">Up to that point with with drug repurposing</p>
<p class="body">So I'm the one that originally discovered Thermodyne is an agent</p>
<p class="body">Because I was self treating myself after I got infected with agents that we did identified through the computer modeling</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So February of 2020 you get infected and how bad is your case? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Bad I thought I was going to die</p>
<p class="body">Gotta remember, I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else</p>
<p class="body">I knew all about this virus</p>
<p class="body">I knew, you know I</p>
<p class="body">I've been watching the videos of people dropping in the street</p>
<p class="body">My lungs were burning</p>
<p class="body">Until I took Famotidine in that relieved</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That and what is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So otherwise known as Pepcid</p>
<p class="body">So just to on this tangent, since I've said it, I've got some good news to announce</p>
<p class="body">First time here. Today. We believe we should have the first patient enrolled in our clinical trials of the combination of modding and celecoxib for treating SARS, Co V2. This is trials being run by the company lighthouse, which is one of my clients</p>
<p class="body">That I've helped design</p>
<p class="body">It's based on my discoveries</p>
<p class="body">They're funded by defense Threat Reduction Agency</p>
<p class="body">So this is another drug combination</p>
<p class="body">Now I work with all these folks like Peter and Peter</p>
<p class="body">That I know you</p>
<p class="body">Know Peter McCollum, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Call on fear Corey</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">But I haven't pushed this drug combination</p>
<p class="body">I've just felt it was inappropriate until we got the trials running, but they're now open and we've passed through the FDA screening process</p>
<p class="body">By the way, we tried to get we had data showing that adding ivorra mekton</p>
<p class="body">Further improve the combination</p>
<p class="body">But the FDA created such enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivar Mac norm that we had to drop it</p>
<p class="body">And by we, what I'm saying is the FDA created so much grief that the DoD decided it</p>
<p class="body">The juice wasn't worth the squeeze and they just</p>
<p class="body">Dropped that arm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Why do you think that is? </p>
<p class="body">What do you think is going on with the the the? </p>
<p class="body">Push back on Ivar Mac 10</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's not just Ivar Mac 10, it's hydroxychloroquine and just to put a marker on that, there's good modeling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade</p>
<p class="body">Of early treatment by the US government</p>
<p class="body">That is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Half a million</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Half a million</p>
<p class="body">That is a well documented number</p>
<p class="body">OK, and it's a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and IBM nectin. Now when you ask me why you're asking me to get into somebody's head</p>
<p class="body">What I can say is a scientist is what I observe</p>
<p class="body">The behaviors, the actions, the correspondence, these bizarre things like you know, don't you know it's a horse drug, y'all? </p>
<p class="body">Right, which is amazingly pejorative</p>
<p class="body">I live in Virginia, OK, I can tell you the people around me</p>
<p class="body">I live in a rural county and I raise horses</p>
<p class="body">That was deeply offensive</p>
<p class="body">To use that language in that way</p>
<p class="body">Hum, but there's clearly been an intentional push</p>
<p class="body">And Zelenko, who's a buddy? </p>
<p class="body">The guy that came out with the original protocol was like, oh, protocol and was the one by the way</p>
<p class="body">That wrote the letter</p>
<p class="body">To Trump advocating for hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p class="body">OK, kind of important to put that together</p>
<p class="body">He's put together a great little video clip in which he clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p class="body">Outside of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Hospital and who? </p>
<p class="body">Who is Janet Woodcock and who's Rick Bright? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Rick Bright was the head of Barda of Barda, the Biomedical Advanced Research director, which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation, Warp speed, etc</p>
<p class="body">So they're the big ticket funder in Health and Human service of of by defense products</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And who is she, Jeff? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp speed for drugs and until very recently head of the FDA</p>
<p class="body">She is known as the person who kind of gets the</p>
<p class="body">I'm credit, let's say for the opioid crisis, for her role at the FDA</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So between the two of them was there was some sort of a concerted effort to suppress the use of hydroxychloroquine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Rick Brighting in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired</p>
<p class="body">To cook on a strategy</p>
<p class="body">Using emergency use authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital, which, by the way, is too late for when hydroxy should be used</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And why do they do? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is, what is the unknown and and there is so many whys and hows behind this</p>
<p class="body">I like to say there's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense</p>
<p class="body">It's about this high</p>
<p class="body">Now there is. I can't prove I can't get into Rick's head. I know Rick quite well</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what he's currently working for, the Rockefeller</p>
<p class="body">He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government but</p>
<p class="body">All I know is they did this</p>
<p class="body">And Rick admits on it on videotape that he did it</p>
<p class="body">And he states that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful</p>
<p class="body">For this virus, now that's false</p>
<p class="body">Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS, one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That wasn't that regular chloroquine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Hydroxy hydroxy hydroxychloroquine are closely related molecules</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Same thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Hydroxy is slightly less toxic by the way, one of the nice things we had actually filed in during Zika</p>
<p class="body">I did a lot of drug repurposing and I filed patents on the use of hydroxy in Zika</p>
<p class="body">One of the reasons is because hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity</p>
<p class="body">They're safe in pregnancy</p>
<p class="body">And you remember Zika was a pregnancy issue</p>
<p class="body">So hydroxy's been out there for a long time as having viral antiviral effects</p>
<p class="body">And the other part of Avrich story that kind of doesn't make sense that there was no data on efficacy</p>
<p class="body">Is that I was the guy that first acquired because I had Chinese connections</p>
<p class="body">The Chinese Protocol for treating this virus</p>
<p class="body">I got it in late February and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and at the ASPOR at the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and response so the government had those documents</p>
<p class="body">When Rick Bright made those determinations, so the assertion that there was no data on hydroxychloroquine at the time when this decision was made is just patently false</p>
<p class="body">It's there, So what is the motivation? </p>
<p class="body">You're right what this none of this makes sense on the only thing you know this is a</p>
<p class="body">This is journalist problem</p>
<p class="body">And you know the classic guidance is full of money</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and so</p>
<p class="body">It it it is bizarre</p>
<p class="body">That Merck would come out</p>
<p class="body">With these explicit statements about the safety of ivermectin</p>
<p class="body">Both Ivar Mac 10 and hydroxy are on the list of essential medicines they have been administered for millions and millions of doses</p>
<p class="body">They're among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable window pharmaceutical window</p>
<p class="body">They, the Ivar Mac 10, is even safer than hydroxy</p>
<p class="body">So Merc coming out out of the blue and saying I ever met in isn't safe</p>
<p class="body">Is really inexplicable</p>
<p class="body">Now another thing is that I sit on the active Committee for drugs as an observer</p>
<p class="body">What is the active committee? </p>
<p class="body">This is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs</p>
<p class="body">I saw</p>
<p class="body">Listen to heard</p>
<p class="body">The representative of Merck</p>
<p class="body">That's on the committee because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives, even though it's an NIH public committee</p>
<p class="body">Explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test Iver Mekton</p>
<p class="body">She said there's no reason to do this now</p>
<p class="body">What's happened since then is is active sticks is still testing Iver Mekton and they've had to go to a higher dose because, as we pointed out, essentially their initial trial design was designed to fail</p>
<p class="body">It was a short course with an adequate levels of drug</p>
<p class="body">And so now they've upped it to. I think it's five days and 600 micrograms per kig. That's the current dosing and active 6 but there is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the Pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivory Mekton as a potential</p>
<p class="body">Alternative early treatment strategy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And if you are going to follow the money, the problem is there's not a lot of never mekton because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it, and it's fairly cheap</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make in</p>
<p class="body">You know, we you can get ivorra mekton</p>
<p class="body">At you know at in bulk at less than a penny, a dose</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, so the original SARS was is is it 90% similar to SARS, Co? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">V2, it's that those terms 90 or 96 or 98, it's those are really not they're they're kind of</p>
<p class="body">You know that you can have something that's 99.9% similar and the difference is all the difference</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But if chloroquine worked on the original SARS or it showed efficacy and original SARS, is it safe to assume like without adequate tests, that hydroxychloroquine would work on? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's the decision that was made by the Chinese</p>
<p class="body">Government, OK, that's my point</p>
<p class="body">I got the original Chinese protocols</p>
<p class="body">This is what they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Were using and they were using it effectively</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, so were they using ivomec known as well? </p>
<p class="body">No no, but other countries have like Japan and India and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Judar Pradesh, as you know has crushed COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah two, could you explain what they did to do that? </p>
<p class="body">Because it's</p>
<p class="body">Kind of fascinated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's not clear</p>
<p class="body">What are the drugs? </p>
<p class="body">So what they did do what we do know and there there's some back story to this that we could go into if you want to</p>
<p class="body">But the observation is, there was a decision made</p>
<p class="body">The virus was just ripping through it or Pradesh</p>
<p class="body">It has almost the same population in the United States, it's huge, OK, dense, urban</p>
<p class="body">Poor all the characteristics of the stereotypes of the Indian countryside</p>
<p class="body">And the virus is just ripping through there</p>
<p class="body">And causing all kinds of death and disease</p>
<p class="body">And the decision was made out of desperation in that province to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province</p>
<p class="body">And it included a number of agents</p>
<p class="body">The composition has not been formally disclosed</p>
<p class="body">It was done in coordination with the United with WHO? </p>
<p class="body">And whatever was in those packages</p>
<p class="body">Was rumored to include fiber mekton</p>
<p class="body">But there was a specific visit of Biden to Modi</p>
<p class="body">And, uh, a decision was made in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages that were being deployed in Uttar Pradesh, which they're still there and Uttar Pradesh is flatlined right now</p>
<p class="body">The rest of the world is yelling about Omicron and and in hospitalizations while South Africa isn't</p>
<p class="body">But Uttar Pradesh is still flat line in terms of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Deaths, so they were visited by someone in the bided administrations at recently</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Right now there's a meeting between Joe Biden and and Modi</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And you believe that out of that meeting, they decided? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">All I know</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what they said</p>
<p class="body">I didn't wasn't invited</p>
<p class="body">All I know is that immediately afterwards there was a decision not to disclose the contents of what was being deployed into depression</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's so crazy to imagine that in the middle of a pandemic, there's one place, one area of India that's extremely successful in combating the virus, and they're not going to say how they did it</p>
<p class="body">I mean, that's that's nuts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, so that's that's where I kind of</p>
<p class="body">My stance in all of this</p>
<p class="body">Is to say here are the facts</p>
<p class="body">Here are the verifiable data</p>
<p class="body">Draw your own conclusion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now February of 2020, you catch it. What did you take? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">From auditing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">From auditing and anything else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, there's nothing else available</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So this was so early on in the pandemic, how did they did? </p>
<p class="body">Did you wind up being hospitalized? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I did have</p>
<p class="body">I did develop long COVID</p>
<p class="body">And people always I always get the why did you take the vaccine? </p>
<p class="body">Well, I took it fairly early on</p>
<p class="body">I took Moderna because that's what the National Guard was deploying in my very rural county in basically central Northern Virginia</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with long COVID? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That was the that was the rumor</p>
<p class="body">At the time</p>
<p class="body">That was then that was I took it for two reasons</p>
<p class="body">I had long COVID it was supposed to help with that, and I knew I was going to have to travel internationally to France and Portugal in the near future</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now, is there any evidence that the vaccine helps against long COVID? </p>
<p class="body">Or is it totally is there anything? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Anecdotally, there was</p>
<p class="body">And I have not seen a peer reviewed solid publication or or preprint</p>
<p class="body">That supports that now, but that was the active rumor at the time</p>
<p class="body">And since then, what we do know? </p>
<p class="body">For sure well documented</p>
<p class="body">If you've got prior COVID and natural immunity, you you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab</p>
<p class="body">Now the other part of my story that often gets overlooked, so I took two doses of Moderna</p>
<p class="body">With the second dose I developed</p>
<p class="body">Stage 3 hypertension</p>
<p class="body">With systolic blood pressure of up to 2:30, OK, I'm lucky to be alive</p>
<p class="body">You know what it means is I've had a stress test of my aorta and my cerebral vascular system, and I didn't have a stroke and I didn't tear my or old shreds</p>
<p class="body">But it's a good thing I had</p>
<p class="body">I had irregularities of heartbeat</p>
<p class="body">Credible hypertension</p>
<p class="body">Pots syndrome narcolepsy</p>
<p class="body">Restless leg syndrome</p>
<p class="body">These are all known side effects that are associated with the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">They're relatively less frequent than the myocarditis in the children and male children in particular</p>
<p class="body">But they're all known on the list of adverse events, and it's very clear that people that have natural immunity</p>
<p class="body">Have a much higher risk factor</p>
<p class="body">For this whole spectrum of adverse events, but even to get jabbed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If they</p>
<p class="body">Even though that's known there's so many people out there telling people who've just recovered from COVID to get vaccinated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It is</p>
<p class="body">There is a number of things here</p>
<p class="body">Are not supported by the science. I'll say gently to be less jentzen's gentle since we're on the Joe Rogan show, I can speak freely it's nucking futz</p>
<p class="body">This is just wrong</p>
<p class="body">It's not consistent with the data</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's it doesn't make sense either. What we know about natural immunity is that natural immunity, at least according to that study in Israel, which is like what 2.5 million people I think</p>
<p class="body">They said that it's between 6 and 13 times more effective than the vaccine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is 6 or 13 times more effective in hospitalized, preventing hospitalized COVID</p>
<p class="body">It's more like 20 or more fold. Yeah 27 fold better at protecting against developing the disease. Remember infection? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
27 
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Does not equal disease</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's only one of over 140 studies</p>
<p class="body">That document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity and oh, by the way, as a vaccine knowledge synonym oenologist</p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't expect anything different</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But the CDC recently disputed this, didn't they? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The IT was a fascinating of play, so the CDC, for most of us that are at all objective in the science world, look at what's going on at the CDC aghast mean</p>
<p class="body">The CDC is just compromised</p>
<p class="body">What they did with that was a very small study with intrinsic bias all over the place, much much smaller than the Israeli study that you're citing, much less rigorous, less statistical power, and they pushed that out as as their</p>
<p class="body">Justification for their position concerning natural immunity, but here it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And who funded that? </p>
<p class="body">Who funded that study? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">CDC would be the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Federal government so they funded this study</p>
<p class="body">They did it themselves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's a CD system</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And do you do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers, and I'm not going</p>
<p class="body">To do it good for you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So either way, there's many, many, many studies that point to the fact that natural immunity is superior</p>
<p class="body">Absolutely, having recovered from COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Like over 140</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And also multiple studies that show that people who have had COVID who get vaccinated after the fact have a higher risk</p>
<p class="body">I think it's between 2:00</p>
<p class="body">And four fold</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Right here on top of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Data two and four fold risk of adverse side</p>
<p class="body">Effects increased risk</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it increased risk</p>
<p class="body">So for you you did not know this when you got vaccinated</p>
<p class="body">What was your thoughts? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, since this was a technology that you were a pivotal part of the creation of, and so you're getting this vaccine, you probably were thinking</p>
<p class="body">Look at this</p>
<p class="body">All my hard work come to fruition</p>
<p class="body">It's going to protect me from the virus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Actually said to the nurse when I took the first jab, I bragged a little bit</p>
<p class="body">I usually don't</p>
<p class="body">I'm usually, you know, keep it on the down low</p>
<p class="body">I don't like to wear it on my shoulder, but I did say, you know, I I</p>
<p class="body">Invented this tech</p>
<p class="body">She's like, oh, that's really cool</p>
<p class="body">Can I take a selfie? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But she asked for it before she shot into you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I have that whole aspiration thing</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm sure she did</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, she's a well trained</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Nurse when you say that whole aspiration thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
8 any skilled medical practitioner when I inject my horses right I I breed Lusitano horses</p>
<p class="body">I've got 20 on the farm</p>
<p class="body">OK I give him drugs all the time</p>
<p class="body">I always aspirate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I saw the shot where Joe Biden got it on TV and they didn't aspirate him</p>
<p class="body">They just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know, I don't know</p>
<p class="body">To say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'll tell you what to say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so so yeah, and was that really a vaccine? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's not the way to do it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And then we go</p>
<p class="body">Down that whole rabbit hole</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, that's my favorite rabbit hole</p>
'cause the fake set remember? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so you know there is there</p>
<p class="body">OK, so you know Joe, you're in media</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I guess</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">What what? </p>
<p class="body">We're what we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare, the level of which we have never seen before, and I in my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks, have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This because there's never been an outbreak that coincided with the use of social media, because there really hasn't been</p>
<p class="body">I mean at H1N1 was was it 2009 that that broke out? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I was pretty active through Zika</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But OK, and that was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't remember the years, but I was on LinkedIn and Twitter all the time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The thing about what's going on now, it's there's a heightened aspect in in terms of like it's the influence on society that social media has</p>
<p class="body">That is, it's it's stronger now than it was two years ago</p>
<p class="body">It's stronger two years ago than it was two years before, it's ramping up exponentially in some sort of a strange way that's affecting society</p>
<p class="body">And then the censorship aspect of it, which is kicked in</p>
<p class="body">And as you said that that they're stepping in line with tech doing it with the pharmaceutical companies doing it with the government</p>
<p class="body">They're all sort of on the same page when it comes to the messaging</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, so now you're now you're going to the next level of you know WTF? </p>
<p class="body">How to how to open that can of worms? </p>
<p class="body">First off, you don't see</p>
<p class="body">You're aware of the trusted news initiative</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can you explain it? </p>
<p class="body">To people, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">There the BBC announced to the world last fall</p>
<p class="body">That this organization that they had led the development of which ties together big tech and big media</p>
<p class="body">In service of the government</p>
<p class="body">End was built expressly for the purpose of protecting the democratic voting system that you know, smalti the democracy</p>
<p class="body">And in voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns</p>
<p class="body">Which you'll recall was the claim that was made against Russia, and so this was the response of the Western nations</p>
<p class="body">To to build this new structure called the Trusted News initiative</p>
<p class="body">That would survey</p>
<p class="body">All information</p>
<p class="body">About elections</p>
<p class="body">And prevent the intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process and creation of undue influence by foreign actors</p>
<p class="body">Shortly after it was created, it was there was an awareness in the Pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p class="body">That this could be used to address a a particular devil challenge that they had, which was the pejorative label anti vaxxers</p>
<p class="body">That's also been deployed against climate skeptics</p>
<p class="body">OK, so anti vaxxers you'll recall is the the label that is used to to basically take anybody out</p>
<p class="body">That is, raising any concerns about vaccine safety</p>
<p class="body">It's it's the pejorative that's applied, and it's makes it really easy for the media to basically take off the table</p>
<p class="body">Anybody that's saying something that is contrary to the interests of the really the vaccine industry</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So there was a decision that this same toolkit, this same integrated</p>
<p class="body">Media and high tech</p>
<p class="body">Organization led by the BBC would be pivoted to resisting vaccine, misinformation, and disinformation</p>
<p class="body">And they put out a proud press announcement last fall that this was what they were going to do, and they defined these things, misinformation and disinformation as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements</p>
<p class="body">Of the World Health Organization or their respective National Health organizations</p>
<p class="body">So if CDC says the world is flat</p>
<p class="body">Then the world is flat</p>
<p class="body">And there will be no discussion about whether or not the world is flat</p>
<p class="body">I'm using, obviously</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">A simplified silly example</p>
<p class="body">So whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci or Tedros etc says is truth by definition, and any any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted</p>
<p class="body">And those people will that are expressing these opinions that would lead to vaccine hesitancy, which to some eyes would be informed consent</p>
<p class="body">And and decisions by an individual that they believe the risk benefit ratio doesn't matter doesn't make sense to them that will</p>
<p class="body">That information will not be allowed and those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media</p>
<p class="body">OK, so that's this kind of if you want to</p>
<p class="body">Unpack this whole thing</p>
<p class="body">It starts by understanding the trusted news initiative and we've got great links about that that have been put out explanatory and links</p>
<p class="body">For instance, I put out a sub stack recently that talks about the trusted news initiative in the censorship in which I linked to both the BBC's Trusted News Initiative website. So you can see what they have to say</p>
<p class="body">And a video that describes the trusted news initiative from my point of view, as somebody that's been on the receiving end of the trusted news initiative</p>
<p class="body">Now that's the starting point</p>
<p class="body">But it doesn't explain the global coordination because Tni is mostly Western</p>
<p class="body">And it doesn't cover a lot of the other</p>
<p class="body">You know Latin America, for instance</p>
<p class="body">Or Spain</p>
<p class="body">It's real</p>
<p class="body">The only way that I can understand</p>
<p class="body">How all of this messaging censorship? </p>
<p class="body">You know, deep platforming</p>
<p class="body">You know what? </p>
<p class="body">What it really is is canceling</p>
<p class="body">And Bobby Kennedy makes the point that the 1st</p>
<p class="body">Real example of cancel culture that we can track</p>
<p class="body">Is Tony Fauci cancelling the esteemed virologist Peter Duesberg? </p>
<p class="body">Because he was raising questions about</p>
<p class="body">The origin of HIV and its role in the disease called called AIDS</p>
<p class="body">I remember when that happened, I was</p>
<p class="body">A young man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I had Pittsburgh on my podcast a long time ago and it was the first time I ever got like extreme pushback from people that were like</p>
<p class="body">I mean, this is after protease inhibitors had been used, so it didn't even make sense and people were saying, yeah, blood on your hands</p>
<p class="body">People are going to die because of this podcast, and I'm like what are you saying like this is a guy who is a biologist, university University of California, Berkeley? </p>
<p class="body">Well professor, yeah I mean brilliant guy and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Recruited yeah, totally one of the best virologists of his generation</p>
<p class="body">Full stop</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And very controversial opinions. But the only way to find out if someone's controversial opinions are valid is to ask questions and talk to them and let them express themselves. And then I wanted to have someone come on and debate him</p>
<p class="body">I could not find anyone willing to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Do it though. It's this is covered in detail in Bobby Kennedy's book about Tony Fauci. It's one of the great case studies</p>
<p class="body">Now we have a more recent example of this cancel culture as it's played by NIH and by Tony</p>
<p class="body">In the emails that came out recently, when you have Cliff Lane, Tony Fauci and the director of the NIH, Francis Collins</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, basically coming out and saying that they're going to ridicule and destroy</p>
<p class="body">Fringe epidemiologists</p>
<p class="body">And what was their sin? </p>
<p class="body">These fringe epidemiologists, that that warranted a concerted effort on the part of the federal government to destroy them</p>
<p class="body">Their sin was raising questions about the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns</p>
<p class="body">OK, and who were these fringe epidemiologists as stated by Francis Collins? </p>
<p class="body">Who by the way has no background in epidemiology or public health? </p>
<p class="body">OK, he's a sequencing guy</p>
<p class="body">That's his claim to fame as the Human Genome Project and the cystic Fibrosis transmembrane regulatory protein</p>
<p class="body">He has no background in immunology, no background or vaccinology, no training in public health</p>
<p class="body">But who are these three fringe epidemiologists? </p>
<p class="body">Well, they happen to be full professors from obscure universities, Oxford, Harvard, and Stanford</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And they were warning about lockdowns they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Were warning about lockdowns in the Great Barrington Declaration</p>
<p class="body">That's what prompted that list</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Could you explain the Great Barrington Declaration? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So these three esteemed high profile academic epidemiologists came together and said and did an analysis, comprehensive analysis about everything that was known about lockdowns and their impacts during infectious disease outbreaks</p>
<p class="body">And they came out with a specific statement</p>
<p class="body">You can find it in the web</p>
<p class="body">Look up great Barrington Declaration and they came out with a specific statement that these lockdowns were going to cause more harm than help</p>
<p class="body">Which was contrary to the messaging that was being putting put out by Tony</p>
<p class="body">And so Tony decided that they had to be destroyed</p>
<p class="body">And then you had Francis Collins</p>
<p class="body">Recently coming on Fox News, after these emails were foied and brought out into the open</p>
<p class="body">In saying that, if we had followed their advice, millions of people would have died</p>
<p class="body">This is the this is the fall back</p>
<p class="body">Anytime you criticize these guys what they say is oh, you're killing people</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean they do it to me too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If they had just done what Sweden had done and some other countries where they did institute lockdowns and they sort of let people just live their lives and make their own choices</p>
<p class="body">They were saying that millions of people 
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Have died, but so it would be so it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Seems but time has shown that Sweden actually had a more effective take</p>
<p class="body">On the virus, I mean it was highly criticized in the beginning</p>
<p class="body">People were really concerned that they weren't taking it seriously enough, and then there was also some</p>
<p class="body">Concerned that it was and you couldn't compare</p>
<p class="body">They weren't comparable because the way Sweden is</p>
<p class="body">It's like small towns and they're separated from each other</p>
<p class="body">It's not a high density situation like New York or Los Angeles or Chicago</p>
<p class="body">But overall, in time we've seen that this vest vest</p>
<p class="body">Respiratory disease spreads, period</p>
<p class="body">No matter what it just, it seems to make its way to people, no matter where you are and what it's done in that country is</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of burned through the population and their mortality rate is lower than most places</p>
<p class="body">Their infection rate is lower than most places</p>
<p class="body">And it didn't do the devastating economic damage and the devastating damage to children that were forced to isolate and not be with their friends and not go to school and not socialize</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So here's an even more fun one</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">That's it, just cuts right to it</p>
<p class="body">You know the the pejorative these days is the country's name is actually fizz real? </p>
<p class="body">It's no longer Israel</p>
<p class="body">The Israeli people are very compliant with their government</p>
<p class="body">And the government has a financial deal with Pfizer, obviously</p>
<p class="body">OK, and they only have Pfizer vaccine</p>
<p class="body">And they're now on jab #4 
<p class="body">There's a natural experiment that's occurring in the Palestinian territory in the surrounding states</p>
<p class="body">Those surrounding states in the Palestinian territory does not have that level of vaccine uptake at all</p>
<p class="body">The mortality in the surrounding states in the Palestinian Authority is substantially less</p>
<p class="body">From this virus than the mortality in Israel</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now is that</p>
<p class="body">Is is it factored by age? </p>
<p class="body">Is it like what is so is there any? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">What's your? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What are the variables? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Good question and</p>
<p class="body">And this this is akin to this mystery mystery story of what's going on in central Africa</p>
<p class="body">In the malaria belt</p>
<p class="body">Where you have really low levels of mortality</p>
<p class="body">And what you're what you're hitting on? </p>
<p class="body">Appropriately, you're getting right to the core of the issue is confounding variables, and in general the the Israeli population is a little bit older than the Palestinian territory on average, so that's a lower risk</p>
<p class="body">Neither one of them are associated with high rates of mortality of morbidity</p>
<p class="body">Of obesity</p>
<p class="body">And so that variable seems to be out that maybe one of the major variables in Africa is that in that malaria belt people generally aren't fat</p>
<p class="body">They happen to also be taking over Magdin and hydroxychloroquine for the indigenous parasites that they have to deal with</p>
<p class="body">So a lot of people were saying, well, that must prove that hydroxy and diver mekton protect</p>
<p class="body">Well, not so as you point out, there's a lot of moving parts here, and so This is why you know, I'm glad you didn't ask me</p>
<p class="body">Well, why is that Robert? </p>
<p class="body">Because I would have said I can't say because there's too many confounding variables</p>
<p class="body">However, it is a fascinating observation that we have this intensively vaccinated code</p>
<p class="body">That is happening</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's also something that's happening to people with COVID as</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, correct, I've experienced it myself</p>
<p class="body">OK, when I had when I wasn't sick and not only brain fog</p>
<p class="body">You can remember the broadcaster cummo when he had COVID he was talking about seeing hallucinations</p>
<p class="body">That is, that is a common consequence of primary COVID infection is not just brain fog, but overt hallucinations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now after the vaccines started to be administered, it was a couple months later</p>
<p class="body">I believe that the Salk Institute published their paper on spike proteins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, and I cited that in the Brett Dark Brett Weinstein Dark Horse Podcast and was immediately attacked by Reuters</p>
<p class="body">For spreading disinformation, because I was speaking that the spike protein was a toxin and there's actually that's one of many papers that have come out since then</p>
<p class="body">Or before</p>
<p class="body">And I didn't say the spike protein on the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">I said the spike protein and Reuters basically took my words, twisted them and then</p>
<p class="body">Attacked me about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It is the spike protein in the vaccine different than the spike protein in the virus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The answer is yes in a way that matters is the question</p>
<p class="body">So the difference is now we're going to get into molecular virology</p>
<p class="body">I'm sorry, but you asked the question</p>
<p class="body">So Spike kind of you can think of it as having a stem part and a head group</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Point your tie if you like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Uh, yeah, right</p>
<p class="body">There's these things sticking out here but but I wanted to illustrate that it also has this little</p>
<p class="body">It's like catcher's glove that sits on top</p>
<p class="body">That is the receptor binding domain</p>
<p class="body">OK, so it's got these these elements that are really important to understand it</p>
<p class="body">And this</p>
<p class="body">This part of the spike protein that is kind of straight and thin</p>
<p class="body">The stalk</p>
<p class="body">Is responsible for the business part of what Spike does spike causes fusion between the virus and the cell</p>
<p class="body">It's what enables the virus to infect the cell</p>
<p class="body">And it's a complex set of events and it changes its structure as it goes through those</p>
<p class="body">It's fascinating stuff if you're into those, OK</p>
<p class="body">You can lock it into the pre fusion confirmation</p>
<p class="body">You can make it so that it will not trigger cell fusion after binding with two little tiny mutations substituting proline</p>
<p class="body">In the S2 domain</p>
<p class="body">And that'll make it so that it can never trigger fusion, which is one of the things that it can do to bake toxicity that has nothing to do with whether or not it combined ACE two up here</p>
<p class="body">Whether or not that catchers Mitt will grab on days too, by the way, spike exists as a trimmer, like a trouble folk, you know, on a on a fishing lure</p>
<p class="body">So these two mutations are in this S2 domain. That's kind of the stem</p>
<p class="body">And it makes it so that it can't fuse</p>
<p class="body">And that's what's in the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">But the rest of the spike is the natural spike</p>
<p class="body">And yes, it does get cut off and it does go in the circulation</p>
<p class="body">That's all been proven, and So what matters about that is all the things I've been talking about about Spike interacting with ACE two and turning on ACE 2</p>
<p class="body">That can all still happen under that's changed</p>
<p class="body">One of the attacks that's made against my staying</p>
<p class="body">This is Oh no</p>
<p class="body">They engineered spike so that it's non toxic</p>
<p class="body">OK that fails two tests</p>
<p class="body">Number one at the time they did this engineering I've I've carefully reviewed the papers</p>
<p class="body">OK, it's all about making it more immunogenic</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing in there about making it less toxic</p>
<p class="body">OK, and</p>
<p class="body">By definition, it will make it less toxic as a fusion fusion protein, but it won't do anything about it</p>
<p class="body">The other parts of of spike and its activities</p>
<p class="body">Then then there is this fundamental logic flaw</p>
<p class="body">In in clinical development and non clinical development and safety and pharmacology</p>
<p class="body">I like to say the French judicial system applies</p>
<p class="body">What that is, is you're guilty until proven innocent</p>
<p class="body">It's the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their engineered spike is safe</p>
<p class="body">They never did that</p>
<p class="body">And so all of this</p>
<p class="body">Pressure that comes back</p>
<p class="body">You know from folks like me saying, hey, this isn't right</p>
<p class="body">OK, and it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck</p>
<p class="body">It's probably toxic because it's the common variable I get criticized because Oh well, you know</p>
<p class="body">Well, prove that it's not safe</p>
<p class="body">I'm sorry that's not the way it works</p>
<p class="body">It's farmers job to prove that it is safe, not my job</p>
<p class="body">To prove that it's not safe</p>
<p class="body">I'm observing this safety signal</p>
<p class="body">The safety signal is there, it is associated with</p>
<p class="body">Vectors that express spike, whether it's the vaccine, the virus or the adeno virus</p>
<p class="body">You know the M RNA, the virus, the virus itself, or the adenoviral vectored spike</p>
<p class="body">Those toxicities are there</p>
<p class="body">And the common variable is the spike protein, so you know and then then the comp comment</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's not a toxin like I'm kind of in the Forrest Gump School of Toxicity</p>
<p class="body">You know if it causes toxicity, it is right</p>
<p class="body">It is a toxin, by definition it is, you know</p>
<p class="body">The toxin is as a toxin does</p>
<p class="body">You know we can argue about the meaning of toxin just like so much of the rest of our language has been perverted during this, but a simple explanation</p>
<p class="body">You know, the simple definition is, does it cause toxicity in people? </p>
<p class="body">I think the answer is pretty clear now</p>
<p class="body">It does the question</p>
<p class="body">They were all arguing about is how often and how</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Bad. This is the question</p>
<p class="body">So why do so many people take the vaccine and have no adverse effect at all? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Great question, and that is a normal situation in any drug</p>
<p class="body">We talked about Bell curves</p>
<p class="body">There's a response curve</p>
<p class="body">Humans are genetically complex and their phenotypic complex</p>
<p class="body">I am not a judicial judicial, judicial, judicial</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Choo Choo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Champion right? </p>
<p class="body">I am not the same body mass index as I was when I was 25</p>
<p class="body">It seems that</p>
<p class="body">The common factor across many people that get both the vaccine adverse events and the disease, and by the way, is a great paper out</p>
<p class="body">That tried to dissect long COVID</p>
<p class="body">And differentiate it from post vaccination syndrome, which is what we're talking about</p>
<p class="body">And they did statistical analysis</p>
<p class="body">Large cohort of patients</p>
<p class="body">Basically they're indistinguishable</p>
<p class="body">Long COVID and post vaccination syndrome in terms of the spectrum of the syndrome, their incidence kind of stuff</p>
<p class="body">They're indistinguishable</p>
<p class="body">Do the same thing</p>
<p class="body">So why one of the factors that seems to be common? </p>
<p class="body">Is this kind of hyper glycemic index? </p>
<p class="body">People that are not necessarily diabetic, but they may be prediabetic or they have problems with carbohydrate metabolism or their eating</p>
<p class="body">Too many sugars or whatever The thing is so they've got elevated hemoglobin, H1C etc. People that have high glycemic index indices seem to be particularly susceptible to these effects</p>
<p class="body">Now that is a syndrome associated with an inflammatory state in blood vessels</p>
<p class="body">You know this</p>
<p class="body">What you're asking again and again because you are who you are, is in plain language</p>
<p class="body">The big you know picture issues that are sitting out there that haven't been adequately addressed now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not only haven't been adequately addressed, but when you do address them, you get demonized, even if you're just asking questions</p>
<p class="body">As far as like what are the numbers, what is the data? </p>
<p class="body">Where can I see this data? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">If you're an academic, you get run out</p>
<p class="body">Yeah no, no</p>
<p class="body">We've talked I I don't want to avoid</p>
<p class="body">You talked about some of the other adverse events and you started talking about</p>
<p class="body">The ones that relate to immune response, yes, and that is the the tip of the iceberg that most people are familiar with is the common CDC never talks about it, but it's clearly there in the literature</p>
<p class="body">You know, in places even New England Journal of Medicine</p>
<p class="body">It's clearly there in the various database</p>
<p class="body">Is latent virus reactivation and the most obvious one is shingles</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if you get shingles, I've had shingles</p>
<p class="body">It hurts that you you don't</p>
<p class="body">You don't miss it</p>
<p class="body">When you get it</p>
<p class="body">Epstein Barr virus, other herpes viruses, cytomegalovirus</p>
<p class="body">What are these all in common? </p>
<p class="body">Their DNA latent DNA, viruses OK so So what? </p>
<p class="body">Latent DNA viruses</p>
<p class="body">Well, we have a bunch of DNA viruses that basically hide inside our body</p>
<p class="body">And they are kept suppressed</p>
<p class="body">Matter of fact, there's a whole thread in vaccinology</p>
<p class="body">We talk about immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system</p>
<p class="body">Part of that has to do with the thymus and it's shrinking</p>
<p class="body">That's what educates T cells by the way, that's one of the reasons why children basically shrugged this disease off</p>
'cause they haven't had that fimic in evolution, but one of the things that happens is your T cells become increasingly focused on suppressing the DNA viruses that we've all been parasitized by</p>
<p class="body">Like cytomegalovirus and so you can watch over time the the diversity of T cells in persons body who's infected by CMV over time as they get older and older their T cells get more and more and more focused on just trying to keep CMV in the box and not let it out</p>
<p class="body">OK, so when we see DNA viruses you know Pandora's box is opening and they're jumping out of there</p>
<p class="body">OK, well the thing that's keeps Pandora's box closed is T cell responses</p>
<p class="body">And then we have, you know, I hope someday you get a</p>
<p class="body">Chance to have Ryan Cole on</p>
<p class="body">Pathologist deep understanding of this</p>
<p class="body">As he points out, he's seeing</p>
<p class="body">Referrals from oncologists</p>
<p class="body">Of cancers that are unusual</p>
<p class="body">They're occurring early</p>
<p class="body">They're behaving irregularly</p>
<p class="body">They're behaving very aggressively now</p>
<p class="body">Right now this is still anecdotal</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to get the audience all wound up, all going to die of cancer</p>
<p class="body">Doctor Malone is not saying we're all going to die of cancer, OK, but</p>
<p class="body">This is another of those little OHS</p>
<p class="body">Because the thing that keeps cancer suppressed is T cells</p>
<p class="body">Then we have the laboratory data that we're seeing abnormalities in the key signaling molecules that that T cells used to talk to each other to like receptors</p>
<p class="body">That are associated in particular with the M RNA vaccines</p>
<p class="body">So something is happening</p>
<p class="body">OK that is causing release of T cell suppression</p>
<p class="body">Reactivation of latent DNA viruses, maybe some signals relating to oncology</p>
<p class="body">Some changes in T cell signaling behavior</p>
<p class="body">And then there's this, this increasing awareness that there's some window of time</p>
<p class="body">Not sure how long after vaccination when you're actually more susceptible to infection</p>
<p class="body">And this may have something to do</p>
<p class="body">So not only is the vaccine efficacy waning</p>
<p class="body">But the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T cell suppression</p>
<p class="body">So there's a whole lot in this box of immunology, and what are the jabs doing to our immune system and how long does it last? </p>
<p class="body">That is, let's say, gently, a little worrisome to some of us that have a background</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In these things, this T cell suppression are</p>
<p class="body">Are there any studies on the amount of time? </p>
<p class="body">That it takes before your your system rebalances itself post jab, and seeing is it accumulative? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you're dealing with three shots or four shots? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's this is this is the I'm sorry this is the obscenity</p>
<p class="body">For me of this whole well, we're going to give four shots because we don't really know when we know we need to do something</p>
<p class="body">I like to talk about the metaphor as a father</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if you've had kids, I'm a grandfather</p>
<p class="body">OK, you give a 3 year old a hammer and everything becomes</p>
<p class="body">A nail</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, OK, that's that's kind of a simple way of saying</p>
<p class="body">People that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it</p>
<p class="body">In this case, there's multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs</p>
<p class="body">The simplest one for everybody to understand is when your son develops seasonal allergies to ragweed pollen or whatever</p>
<p class="body">And it's so bad that he can't go to school</p>
<p class="body">His eyes are running</p>
<p class="body">He can't play in sports whatever you're like, oh we gotta do something about this I'm gonna take him to rheumatologist allergist</p>
<p class="body">And see what they can do</p>
<p class="body">They do a bunch of tests and they say, oh, your son is allergic to ragweed pollen or whatever</p>
<p class="body">The thing is, OK, what do they do? </p>
<p class="body">Well they give him</p>
<p class="body">What are those shots? </p>
<p class="body">They're high doses of antigen</p>
<p class="body">That are administered repeatedly to your child</p>
<p class="body">And what it does is induces something that is immunologist</p>
<p class="body">We call high zone tolerance</p>
<p class="body">Hi, zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen to shut down T cells</p>
<p class="body">Against in an antigen specific fashion</p>
<p class="body">So there's that</p>
<p class="body">The other thing with the multiple jabs is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched</p>
<p class="body">OK, they don't fit the current, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I pause you for a second before you continue? </p>
<p class="body">So you're saying that by if, like if someone is allergic to things and they go to an allergist and they start getting shots, those shots shut down T cell response, correct? </p>
<p class="body">So those shots by doing so and shutting down T cell response</p>
<p class="body">The idea is that it kicks your immune system in and it's supposed to fight off these things</p>
<p class="body">Does it make you more vulnerable to other diseases? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">They because they're using that antigen, OK, the ragweed pollen? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's causing deletion or downregulation of the team memory population responsible for responding to ragweed pollen</p>
<p class="body">So what it's doing is selectively shutting down</p>
<p class="body">The T response against that antigen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And but what about everything else? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, generally not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It won't affect it, no? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I won't say it won't affect it, but it the effect on the overall immune response is negligible in that this is done clinically routinely</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there's there's those two things</p>
<p class="body">There's this short term issue we don't know how long it lasts</p>
<p class="body">There's the</p>
<p class="body">The high zone tolerance issue</p>
<p class="body">And then there is with their multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus</p>
<p class="body">That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping it's gonna protect against this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Flu, well, that's one of the most confusing things about this push for people to get boosted now</p>
<p class="body">With Omicron 'cause they keep saying with Omicron, we need to get, but that's a vaccine escape variant, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, among other things, so that if when you want to open that can of Omicron</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I want to say what we know so far is at least Peter McCullough said this and I believe several other people have said this as well, that the immunity that you may have had to the alpha variant or the delta variant</p>
<p class="body">It does not seem to work very well against Omicron</p>
<p class="body">That's true</p>
<p class="body">Nor does the immunity imparted by vaccines</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">By the way, since we're we're down, this little rabbit hole</p>
<p class="body">Let me just say one thing Peter called me and he said Robert make sure you talk to Joe</p>
<p class="body">And make it clear that although I spoke clearly and forcefully</p>
<p class="body">About one and done when I was on his show that was before Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and so Peter wanted me to make sure that your audience</p>
<p class="body">Knew no yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yes, we we've actually talked about that because I have several friends right now that have tested positive for COVID for a second time and that is post that podcast with him</p>
<p class="body">He was pretty sure that if you got delta you would never get it again, but I know people that have had not I</p>
<p class="body">Honestly I don't know anybody who had delta, which was the last</p>
<p class="body">Phase I know people who had the original version of COVID who have now gotten Omicron</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">In my case, I had the original Wuhan strain and I got infected with Delta and I had disease for about 3 days and that's after taking to the two jabs wow</p>
<p class="body">So so yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then how far after taking the two jobs, was it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">About four months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Four months, yeah, four months</p>
<p class="body">So that's still inside the window of efficacy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's another thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You say you're infected by COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, like nine months like yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Early on February, nine months, OK, but you still had a horrible reaction</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">To it totally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then even that</p>
<p class="body">This is pure speculation</p>
<p class="body">The waning efficacy of the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Does that have an effect on your natural immunity? </p>
<p class="body">The natural immunity that you've had? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So you're now opening up the big big</p>
<p class="body">Can a whip pass? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that a D? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
80 So that's a whole another rabbit hole, and I like to call it vaccine enhanced infection or disease because 80 is just one subset</p>
<p class="body">Of that 
<p class="body">OK, but there is signs in some data</p>
<p class="body">And we were</p>
<p class="body">We were talking about this just before the broadcast</p>
<p class="body">From Denmark, among other places</p>
<p class="body">Of negative efficacy</p>
<p class="body">Against omicron 
<p class="body">As a function of the number of vaccinations up to three</p>
<p class="body">Negative efficacy, positive efficacy means it protects you</p>
<p class="body">Negative efficacy means your probability of being infected is higher</p>
<p class="body">If you've taken the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">And it's compared to unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">It seems to be somewhat higher</p>
<p class="body">If you've had one jab, even worse, even more likely to get infected if you've had two jabs even more infect likely to get infected</p>
<p class="body">If you had three jobs now, don't jump straight</p>
<p class="body">To 80 E</p>
<p class="body">Because the problem</p>
<p class="body">Just to illustrate this confounding variable problem, which is what all the statisticians argue about endlessly</p>
<p class="body">Is that? </p>
<p class="body">There's all kinds of things that can complicate this interpretation</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to give you the simple one</p>
<p class="body">If somebody feels that they're fully Vaxxed and they're living, you know their young person in Denmark or whatever in Europe, they're more likely to go engage in risky behaviors</p>
<p class="body">Such as maybe they go out clubbing</p>
<p class="body">Whereas before they may have said no, I'm not going to go out clubbing you crazy</p>
<p class="body">Now they feel like they're Superman</p>
<p class="body">They've got</p>
<p class="body">A shield right? </p>
<p class="body">And so they engage in more risky behaviors, and so there's an example of a confounding variable, one of many</p>
<p class="body">So that's the that's the I want to caution that I'm not saying that this shows that we're having vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Enhanced infection, I'm saying that this is a risk which the FDA knew about</p>
<p class="body">Explicitly identified told the vaccine manufacturers they should set up studies to detect whether or not it's happening</p>
<p class="body">But didn't force them to do it</p>
<p class="body">This is another one of the huge FDA fails here</p>
<p class="body">They had the right and responsibility to ensure that we had good data about this and they took a pass</p>
<p class="body">They said vaccine manufacturer</p>
<p class="body">We think you should do this, but you know it's optional and so they never did it</p>
<p class="body">No surprise</p>
<p class="body">It's like first rule of clinical development</p>
<p class="body">When you're in Big Pharma, you never ask a question that you don't want to know the answer to</p>
<p class="body">Unless you're absolutely forced to do it</p>
<p class="body">That's why the FDA is supposed to do its job, but in this case with enhanced disease, a known risk of all prior coronavirus vaccine development efforts, including veterinary</p>
<p class="body">Chronic complication with those efforts</p>
<p class="body">The reason why I focused on drug repurposing? </p>
<p class="body">We're going to need drugs</p>
<p class="body">Best way we can get drugs is drug repurposing, yay</p>
<p class="body">And then I got my team to focus on that</p>
<p class="body">That's why we did that</p>
<p class="body">FDA is known that this is a risk</p>
<p class="body">Although vaccine ologists notes a risk, it's in the literature</p>
<p class="body">We've all been kind of watching carefully, so I have is this risk and a manifest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I pause you for a? </p>
<p class="body">Second, when you're saying statistically</p>
<p class="body">It seems that one jab makes you more likely to get Omicron than unvaccinated 2 jabs, even more so</p>
<p class="body">Three jobs more so</p>
<p class="body">Where is this date? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's coming</p>
<p class="body">It's a series of analysis</p>
<p class="body">There's a really active group of biostatisticians worldwide in right now that are picking apart the primary data that's coming out</p>
<p class="body">There was a paper that was published from the Netherlands, as I recall</p>
<p class="body">That had or or it was a publication from official publication by the government</p>
<p class="body">That had the primary data and then this primary data has been analyzed re analyzed</p>
<p class="body">Discuss on sub stack blah blah blah torn apart and rebuild</p>
<p class="body">Now we put out a sub stack statement that summarizes some of this that you can easily find from us, but it's an ongoing debate, but the</p>
<p class="body">The effect size is now now what the statisticians are arguing about is well, whether or not they had the right number for the denominator of total cases</p>
<p class="body">This gets back to my point that the databases are all contaminated because the incidence of the virus in the population</p>
<p class="body">Is a function of testing</p>
<p class="body">In other words, you don't look for it</p>
<p class="body">You don't see it, then you assume you're not having it right</p>
<p class="body">And in the Netherlands they have one of the best testing systems, so they have rigorously testing everybody for whether or not they get in the virus, and so those numbers are a little</p>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<p class="body">Sketchy, and that's what everybody is arguing about is is should we be looking at only the 12 and above cohort? </p>
<p class="body">You know it's all this is, but the effect size is so large</p>
<p class="body">That it's we can</p>
<p class="body">We can argue about these confounding variables until the cows come home, but it's a big effect</p>
<p class="body">It's going to be hard to account for otherwise</p>
<p class="body">It is not in peer reviewed publications</p>
<p class="body">This kind of stuff is wicked hard to publish these days and it takes months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of COVID? </p>
<p class="body">Because this particular strain of COVID this omicron? </p>
<p class="body">Is a vaccine escape variant, meaning that it's sort of tried to find its way around the protection of the vaccine so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Now you're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's selected for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That so now you're trying to impose a high</p>
<p class="body">What you're doing is generating hypothesis, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Which is good</p>
<p class="body">And one of many possible hypotheses, and so in a world a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things and do these kinds of studies and examine these kinds of variables without being right in social media, we would have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others</p>
<p class="body">No, that's my my way of not answering your question</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I understand well</p>
<p class="body">Is there a mechanism that would point to one of two things, whether it is a a decrease in an immune response of a person who's been vaccinated, or some opportunity? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So so let me throw out so you just hit</p>
<p class="body">Let me go down the rabbit hole of that first comment</p>
<p class="body">You made</p>
<p class="body">OK, So what we're doing is with with administering a mismatched vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Is we're driving the effector and memory cells</p>
<p class="body">B&T 
<p class="body">Towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists</p>
<p class="body">So it's not in in immune response</p>
<p class="body">You don't get everything</p>
<p class="body">End with what I think you know you didn't ask me the question, but I'm going to answer it anyhow</p>
<p class="body">What is your hypothesis for the poor durability of the vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">My answer is it looks to me like original antigenic sin</p>
<p class="body">Well, that's kind of a cool</p>
<p class="body">Terminology what that means? </p>
<p class="body">Let's unpack original antigenic sin and I think what could be happening with these data as your</p>
<p class="body">Just following your hypothesis, you just shared consistent with that</p>
<p class="body">Is that we're driving the immune response towards responding to an antigen</p>
<p class="body">The receptor binding domain, a spike that no longer exists with Omicron</p>
<p class="body">It it is, become clear it was initially denied, but it's become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold corona viruses that have significant immunologic cross reactivity with SARS, Co V2</p>
<p class="body">And the problem with that</p>
<p class="body">In original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated? </p>
<p class="body">Now let me unpack that in a way that kind of makes sense for the common person we all know</p>
<p class="body">That well in war</p>
<p class="body">The the homily is we're always best prepared for the last war</p>
<p class="body">OK, in your life you're the sum of your prior life experiences, biases, how you respond to I mean in in your martial arts you must know this</p>
<p class="body">Right, deeply what you've experienced in the past in prior fights is going to bias how you respond to a new opponent</p>
<p class="body">OK, same happens with your immune system does that</p>
<p class="body">Make sense, yes? </p>
<p class="body">OK, super OK, you now understand original antigenic sin</p>
<p class="body">OK, because the prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen, you know if you are are are having martial art</p>
<p class="body">With a person of a certain ethnic background or or physical characteristics or whatever, and they have certain strategies that they use, the next time you encounter somebody that looks like that and seems to move like that, you're going to say, oh, they're going to use the same kind of strategies your immune system acts the same way</p>
<p class="body">With viruses</p>
<p class="body">And it could be that they've they've got a whole different toolkit and you're busy fighting this war, and they come in and boom, you're dead, right? </p>
<p class="body">Same kind of thing</p>
<p class="body">OK, so we've got a new pathogen, but it's got a series of of overlaps with the old ones that we've seen before and our immune system is biased to respond</p>
<p class="body">As if it's the old one now</p>
<p class="body">To make matters worse, we're taking the spike protein</p>
<p class="body">Only one of the proteins, the dominant</p>
<p class="body">Immunologically dominant protein</p>
<p class="body">And we're japon everybody multiple times</p>
<p class="body">And driving memory cells and effector cells</p>
<p class="body">That are two a virus that is not the one we're encountering</p>
<p class="body">So it could very well be that as you're taking more jabs</p>
<p class="body">You're further skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection too</p>
<p class="body">Omicron, compared to somebody that is immunologically naive, they only have</p>
<p class="body">Presumably they've either recovered from an earlier 'cause we gotta remember the baseline group, the non vaccinated group is actually complicated because it's got those that haven't had the virus</p>
<p class="body">Before, but they've had beta coronaviruses</p>
<p class="body">And those that have had prior infection are naturally immune</p>
<p class="body">So that's you can appreciate that looking at these things kind of get squirrely</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of moving parts, but when you see a signal this strong</p>
<p class="body">It's saying something is going on</p>
<p class="body">You ought to pay attention to it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In my opinion, what is the difference between the spike protein that's generated from the injection of the vaccine versus? </p>
<p class="body">All of the variables that your body encounters when it's been infected by COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is another brilliant question</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying this to butter you up</p>
<p class="body">And thank you for asking it</p>
<p class="body">That's, uh, that was a very broad question, and this is a peel</p>
<p class="body">The onions, onion layers situation</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you said what are the differences? </p>
<p class="body">Let's start at a high level</p>
<p class="body">When you get infected where I get infected</p>
<p class="body">It's typically nasal or pharynx</p>
<p class="body">It's coming in through the mucosal membranes of your</p>
<p class="body">OK, and by the way, that's one of the other things that's kind of cool</p>
<p class="body">About omicron</p>
<p class="body">In a good way</p>
<p class="body">Is that the prior strains infect mostly deep lung and there's really fascinating data from Hong Kong suggesting that Omicron is infecting upper airway more</p>
<p class="body">That is a characteristic of less pathogenic influenza viruses</p>
<p class="body">And hopefully what we know about Omicron is, even though it's more infectious</p>
<p class="body">And replicates the higher levels</p>
<p class="body">It's less pathogenic as a paradox, well that could explain it</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there may be some good news at Nongkrong, but getting back to your question, when you take the jab</p>
<p class="body">You get a</p>
<p class="body">I don't know how to say a spike of spike</p>
<p class="body">You get a bolus, a peak fairly rapidly</p>
<p class="body">Of this viral protein</p>
<p class="body">And it's in your body</p>
<p class="body">In it circulating in your blood, we know that there's a Harvard study Brigham and Women's nurses spike protein circulation after vaccination</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I pause you? </p>
<p class="body">One one second I like when you test for kovid you go in through the nose</p>
<p class="body">If someone is getting Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Or are they less likely to test positive? </p>
<p class="body">Because you're swabbing their nose, no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">More, all of these are initially coming in here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So it still would exist in the nose even though it's affecting the back of the throat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It seems to be well, it's it's clearly producing equal or higher levels</p>
<p class="body">Delta was significantly higher in the nose</p>
<p class="body">By PCR with all of the caveats about the problems with that cycle number and Omicron seems to be even higher, significantly higher</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">OK, so hit your nose and then it goes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Down, OK, and it's affecting the throat</p>
<p class="body">For some reason</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot of the people that I know that got Omicron had a throat ache</p>
<p class="body">Throat a soreness of the throat before</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is, paradoxically, really good news</p>
<p class="body">By the way, that's called primary data anecdotal primary data, but it beats modeling data from the CDC, which is what the New York Times has been reporting that we all have</p>
<p class="body">By this point, we're all supposed to have 70 or 80% of all the virus in the United States is supposed to be omicron, that is based on what is now known to be erroneous modeling</p>
<p class="body">And all of us that were inside when we saw this come out, we knew the group in the UK that did the modeling and we were like, oh, these guys have overpromised 
<p class="body">They have basically put out scare modeling all the way through this outbreak and we should take this with a grain of salt</p>
<p class="body">And now the press is all backpedaling and the CDC is backpedaling, saying oh</p>
<p class="body">But I think we got it wrong and there's still a lot of delta in the population</p>
<p class="body">But you know your buddies</p>
<p class="body">If it's circulating here in in Austin and you're hearing people that are having more the sore throat and runny nose and less of the my chest is burning and I've lost taste and smell</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, that's just to kind of open that up a little bit</p>
<p class="body">With H1N1 influenza just to take one example</p>
<p class="body">We have high pathogenicity and low pathogenicity versions of H1N1. What that means is some will kill you and some won't</p>
<p class="body">More or less</p>
<p class="body">The difference seems to be the virus</p>
<p class="body">The receptor, the nuances of the receptor that the virus is hitting and using to initially infect cells</p>
<p class="body">And the low pathogenicity H1N ones infect the upper airway</p>
<p class="body">And the high pathogenicity H1N ones infect the deep lung</p>
<p class="body">The prior SARS, Kobe ones have been hit in deep lung</p>
<p class="body">This report that you're giving me from your buddies</p>
<p class="body">That you think is probably Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Is consistent with the Hong Kong data</p>
<p class="body">And it all fits into a box, and we know from South Africa for sure</p>
<p class="body">That omicron in where you know the WHL made the statement</p>
<p class="body">There are no known deaths associated with Omicron in the in the world</p>
<p class="body">Now there may be a couple somewhere</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I thought it was just the United States</p>
<p class="body">I didn't know they were saying for the world because there there was a we</p>
<p class="body">We just read something that said there were several that were associated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Now there's there's as I said</p>
<p class="body">Over time there will be deaths associated</p>
<p class="body">Remember, we talked about the difference between causal and association</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, yeah? And also the fact that 95% of the people who have died from COVID had an average of four comorbidities here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK and</p>
<p class="body">You're on it, yeah so</p>
<p class="body">And and now it's been documented at least two cases when there were reported deaths</p>
<p class="body">From Omicron and people actually went back, they got picked up in the legacy media and circulated as Oh my God, it's going to kill us again</p>
<p class="body">More fear **** 
<p class="body">Then people went again like they did with the Ivy Mekton story</p>
<p class="body">Remember about the hospital, it was all full of ivory mekton toxicity and then someone bothered to call the hospital</p>
<p class="body">Same story, sorry Nope, those weren't omicron deaths</p>
<p class="body">Just something that got reported and amplified in the legacy media, so regardless the mortality of Omicron is remarkably low</p>
<p class="body">I think we can all agree on that</p>
<p class="body">That's the list of symptoms from Omicron published in Nature, I think</p>
<p class="body">Recently are pretty much 100% overlap with common cold</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And there are coronaviruses that are common colds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the beta coronaviruses that I was talking about when I was talking about</p>
<p class="body">Original antigenic sin</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So if you test positive for the common cold, do you test positive for a corona virus? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you take a COVID test? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The common cold is a is a</p>
<p class="body">In general that's not</p>
<p class="body">Tested for it</p>
<p class="body">No, it's it's a it's a grab</p>
<p class="body">Bag of stuff</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, it's rhinoviruses, it's coronaviruses</p>
<p class="body">It's influenza</p>
<p class="body">You know it's a lot of things</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of respiratory viruses that are floating around</p>
<p class="body">But getting back on on track with Omicron</p>
<p class="body">It is absolutely looking like Omicron is a mild variant</p>
<p class="body">It is absolutely</p>
<p class="body">Able to escape prior vaccination</p>
<p class="body">The control of prior vaccination</p>
<p class="body">Typically with mismatched vaccine</p>
<p class="body">It seems to be also able to infect a subset of people that are naturally immune</p>
<p class="body">Probably less than the subset that get infected with vaccination</p>
<p class="body">But in this is a kind of a key message to your audience</p>
<p class="body">The reproductive coefficient that's more fancy language</p>
<p class="body">The reproductive coefficient</p>
<p class="body">But many of your audience is going to know that that's the are not</p>
<p class="body">The R nought of the original strain will hunt</p>
<p class="body">Strain was about two to three</p>
<p class="body">That means that if I'm infected on average without any other interventions, I'll infect 2 to three other people</p>
<p class="body">OK, and for delta the R nought was more in the range of five to six if I'm infected</p>
<p class="body">No vaccination, no social distancing, no masking, blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">The average rate of transmission would be, I would infect five or six people</p>
<p class="body">In the case of Omicron</p>
<p class="body">The arnaout, the rebase reproduction coefficient is in the range of seven to 10</p>
<p class="body">OK, that is a wicked high</p>
<p class="body">That is measles</p>
<p class="body">What that means I'm going to translate that into simple language</p>
<p class="body">We are all going to get infected</p>
<p class="body">Whether you use masks or not, use social distancing or not unless you're going to go live on the Mir trail and not talk to anybody when you pass them</p>
<p class="body">You're going to get infected</p>
<p class="body">So this gets to the key point</p>
<p class="body">You know, find a doc that'll administer early treatments</p>
<p class="body">And you know what they are and you just had the expert on Peter McCullough</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's incredibly difficult to get this stuff now, that's what's incredible</p>
<p class="body">Monocle and runs</p>
<p class="body">That was the next thing I was going to ask you about</p>
<p class="body">Why would they do that? </p>
<p class="body">When well, what is the percentage of delta versus Omicron out there, and how do? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">We know, so here that's I just alluded to that a minute ago, and this is another fascinating story, and it's kind of being covered up</p>
<p class="body">It's starting to be covered by the press, but they're not going back to the cause</p>
<p class="body">OK, remember I said that there was a group in the UK</p>
<p class="body">Imperial College didn't give the specifics before, but it's a group in the UK that does modeling</p>
<p class="body">And they came out with some modeling projections that basically the entire UK hospital system was going to be inundated with</p>
<p class="body">And a lot of us looked at that and went</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, those are the same guys that have predicted that we're going to have, you know, millions and millions and millions of dead and and they're going to be body stacked up</p>
<p class="body">And, you know, coolers in the UK</p>
<p class="body">And it sure looks like they may have overshot</p>
<p class="body">Again, the CDC seems to have taken those modeling</p>
<p class="body">Projections in those models</p>
<p class="body">And they put out a member in mid December right before Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, you're all going to get infected by COVID and and it's going to sweep through and we're going to have 80% of COVID by this time of this month</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How about that ridiculous press release from the White House? </p>
<p class="body">That said, we're the winner of the unvaccinated death</p>
<p class="body">You know, experience a winner of death, and the overwhelming hospitalizations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">All I can say is that the political genius behind that should be taken out in the behind in the woodshed and given a good weapon because that was just horrible political messaging</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So horrible and in the terms in terms of Omicron, so inaccurate, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I contrasted</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but it doesn't matter, and that's that's that's the core thing</p>
<p class="body">Of of this, chronic angst of of what the heck is going on? </p>
<p class="body">This doesn't make any sense at all</p>
<p class="body">You know, I don't want to get too off your topic, but</p>
<p class="body">Our government is out of control</p>
<p class="body">On this and they are lawless</p>
<p class="body">They completely disregard bioethics</p>
<p class="body">They completely disregard the federal common rule</p>
<p class="body">They have broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years</p>
<p class="body">These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly</p>
<p class="body">Illegal, they are explicitly inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code</p>
<p class="body">They're explicitly inconsistent with the Belmont report</p>
<p class="body">They are flat out illegal and they don't care</p>
<p class="body">And the only thing standing between us</p>
<p class="body">And it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my</p>
<p class="body">You know, the unfortunate colleagues in the DoD</p>
<p class="body">Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What's wrong? </p>
<p class="body">What do you mean by the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">DoD, the mandated vaccines for all the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're mandated for everyone in the DoD</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Personnel forever, yeah</p>
<p class="body">You know what's going on in the White House is a whole another hours talk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm sure it is back to Omicron and Delta</p>
<p class="body">How do we know like what are the when you get tested? </p>
<p class="body">Like when I was tested and I came out positive for COVID</p>
<p class="body">I have no idea what I got</p>
<p class="body">I assume it was delta 'cause that's what I heard was going around, but when they release these numbers, where are they getting that data? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So in terms of this specific one, I'm sorry I got off track, so I was talking about Imperial College modeling, and the CDC seemed have picked up on</p>

<p class="body">No worries</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That yeah</p>
<p class="body">And the last data they had, it's actually Peter that sent me the data</p>
<p class="body">We did a podcast about it</p>
<p class="body">So he sent me the the modeling data</p>
<p class="body">And and he sent me the documentation that the modeling data that the CDC was putting out in the New York Times and the Presinal amplified</p>
<p class="body">You know when we all said oh we're going to have 70 or 80% omicron in the population by this time of this year? </p>
<p class="body">The only actual data they had was up to about December 4th as I recall, and it showed only a tiny fraction of omicron in the population, but then they applied their mathematical models that they apparently got from Imperial College, and they said, oh, the curve is going to look like this, and therefore that's where we're going to be at this point in time, and therefore we're going to have 70% infection</p>
<p class="body">And the press all picked it up and they just assumed that that was based on real data, not modeled data</p>
<p class="body">What I'm hearing from docs in the field again and again, and you know, I had a bunch of people call me before I came on your show</p>
<p class="body">Everybody was like Robert say this to Joe, but you know you're so important that everybody wants to get their angle in</p>
<p class="body">What I'm hearing in the field is that delta is still dominant</p>
<p class="body">And these are hospitalists and and people treating disease, and so they're seeing a skewed population</p>
<p class="body">But it's important to remember that when the CDC says those kinds of numbers, they're talking about incidents, that is, that is the moment you know how many have actually been infected at that slice of time, but</p>
<p class="body">What you see in the hospitals and this is something the press misses all the time</p>
<p class="body">So they do like you're hearing all this fear **** about how the hospitals have filled up in New York City and blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">Blah blah OK</p>
<p class="body">Omicron causes a short term limited illness</p>
<p class="body">Delta is wicked bad, and it puts you in the hospital when it puts you in the hospital</p>
<p class="body">You can be there for a month to two months</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">What you're seeing in hospitalized cases right now appears to be dominantly delta</p>
<p class="body">Because the CDC overestimated the fraction of the population that was getting they overestimated how aggressively omicron was going to move into the US population</p>
<p class="body">Maybe that means our social distancing and masking is working</p>
<p class="body">I don't know, but it's not moving in as fast as they had been projecting, and the bulk of the disease that the docs that I'm talking to are seeing in hospitals appears to be delta</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But wouldn't that be because the people that are catching delta are the ones that need to be hospitalized versus the people that are catching omicron? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Precisely OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They don't need it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">But here's the rub and you I'm looping back now to your antibody point</p>
<p class="body">Is the geniuses in our public health system said, Oh no Omicron, based on this modeling data? </p>
<p class="body">Is going to be moving into the population is going to dominate things</p>
<p class="body">We need to pull the monoclonals that are delta specific and only administer only allow people to use the monoclonals that are Omicron specific because it's going to drive further evolution otherwise</p>
<p class="body">I guess that's their logic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I haven't heard that logic at all</p>
<p class="body">I've heard that is that the monoclonal antibodies are ineffective against Omicron, but I've never seen ivol</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's that's you're saying you're saying the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Thing I've also, but I've never seen any data that the</p>
<p class="body">Monoclonal any letters</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">There are data</p>
<p class="body">There are data that the that it's in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Where's that at? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Peer reviewed literature</p>
<p class="body">Now there's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That it's ineffective against Omicron</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I wouldn't say ineffective, less effective based on laboratory neutralization assays</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So in vitro correct OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so you know Joe lab lapidot</p>
<p class="body">Certain general</p>
<p class="body">In the state of Florida</p>
<p class="body">Has put out public statements now on I think his Twitter, among other things, saying decrying what the federal government has done of pulling all of the regular monoclonals</p>
<p class="body">What I'm hearing from frontline docs is those those you know, older, Regeneron, monoclonals, et cetera</p>
<p class="body">Are still very effective in their hospitalized population, presumably because it's still predominantly delta and yet they're no longer able to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Get it so the government has literally stopped the distribution of medicine</p>
<p class="body">True effective medicine for a disease that exists currently</p>
<p class="body">When has that ever happened before? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Uh, hydroxychloroquine and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but in this level where like hydroxychloroquine and ivory mekton were off label uses, this is something that has emergency use authorization</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The unlabeled unlabeled yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is wild</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It is, uh, are they brain dead? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Are they trying to just encourage vaccine vaccination? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Are they trying? </p>
<p class="body">To kill</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that what all it is? </p>
<p class="body">Is this a money grab? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So here's another</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, what is that so? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Version, I mean there's that when you see this kind of</p>
<p class="body">Of public policy from logic</p>
<p class="body">Then it causes thinking people like yourself to say what the hell is going? </p>
<p class="body">On here, right? </p>
<p class="body">And then we go down the rabbit hole</p>
<p class="body">Is it this that or the other thing one of the things in that spectrum of what's going on? </p>
<p class="body">The emergencies authorizations are predicated on</p>
<p class="body">Policy determinations that were in a state of emergency</p>
<p class="body">Those are now two years old</p>
<p class="body">They're expiring</p>
<p class="body">There there is</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying this is what's going on in their head</p>
<p class="body">But there is another perverse incentive here</p>
<p class="body">To amplify the fear **** 
<p class="body">Into amplify</p>
<p class="body">If you buy into the hypothesis</p>
<p class="body">That for some reason</p>
<p class="body">There are incentives for the government</p>
<p class="body">To maintain the state of emergency</p>
<p class="body">That is 1 explanation given that those declarations are expiring and will have to be re implemented if 'cause if they're not</p>
<p class="body">Then all of this emergency use authorization vanishes, like dust</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So are you saying? </p>
<p class="body">Or are you implying that perhaps one of the reasons why they were moving monoclonal antibodies is to? </p>
<p class="body">Enhance the amount of people that are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Sick, I'm saying it is in the spectrum of the range of possible, just the same as the withholding of early treatments is inexplicable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And this is inexplicable in that we know that they're very effective</p>
<p class="body">I, I've personal evidence that they're very effective</p>
<p class="body">They work, they work great on me</p>
<p class="body">The fact that there are moving this and that you would even consider</p>
<p class="body">That the reason why they're doing it is to extend the emergency use authorization for political reasons is that's insane</p>
<p class="body">That's terrifying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's hard for me to reconcile</p>
<p class="body">The behavior of the government</p>
<p class="body">In its public health decisions with the data</p>
<p class="body">And I'm I'm it's it's you</p>
<p class="body">It's like there's two bins</p>
<p class="body">Is it incompetence or is it maleficence maleficence? </p>
<p class="body">Or are they is it is? </p>
<p class="body">Is there some ulterior political motive? </p>
<p class="body">Or they just</p>
<p class="body">Dumb stupid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If if there's some political motive, if that's written anywhere, someone is going to jail</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if that if that comes out, if that's somehow another gets leaked Jesus ******* Christ, that's scary</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That that, well, there's, there's you know</p>
<p class="body">So I wish it was so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I wish it was so too</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying that and I might be completely wrong</p>
<p class="body">I made me totally naive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Of what the lab leak? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the the the you know the for me? </p>
<p class="body">The disclosure of emails that Cliff Lane</p>
<p class="body">Tony Fauci and Francis Collins actively conspired to destroy any discussion of the appropriateness of lockdown strategies and in the mainstream press hardly covers it</p>
<p class="body">And there are no</p>
<p class="body">There are no consequences</p>
<p class="body">The document trail having to do with the gain of function research</p>
<p class="body">And the implication of NIH</p>
<p class="body">And by the way, dechra in that</p>
<p class="body">Having absolutely no consequences for anybody</p>
<p class="body">We're in an environment in which truth and consequences are fungible</p>
<p class="body">They this is modern media management and warfare</p>
<p class="body">The truth is what the those that are managing</p>
<p class="body">The Trusted News initiative say it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is wild</p>
<p class="body">And for me personally, it's so confusing that I find myself in a situation where I feel compelled to have people like you want, because I don't know where else this is gonna get out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't so so</p>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<p class="body">On behalf of, you know, in my case I'm the President of</p>
<p class="body">The International Alliance of Physicians and Scientists. We are over 16,000 people from all over the world. Physicians and scientists</p>

<p class="body">We are gobsmacked about what's going on</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And over a period of two years, the world is completely changed in</p>

<p class="body">And license to practice medicine</p>
<p class="body">Because we are speaking about these matters and you can label me however you want to label me</p>
<p class="body">I don't care. I've done what I've done in my career. I'm at a stage at 62 years old</p>

<p class="body">They're losing faith in the scientific enterprise</p>
<p class="body">They're losing faith in our government</p>
<p class="body">They're losing faith in the vaccine enterprise</p>
<p class="body">I mean what is going to be the long term consequences of public health when you have a large fraction of the population who wasn't anti vaxxer that perjorative before that are now saying Oh my God? </p>
<p class="body">If this is how these people make decisions, I don't want anything to do with it</p>
<p class="body">I certainly don't want it jabbed into</p>
<p class="body">My kid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's one of the more disturbing things that the opposite of that is one of the more disturbing things about this pandemic is how people have just decided because they're scared and because they want a solution that the pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p class="body">Have their best interests at heart and that they're not these</p>
<p class="body">Machines that are designed to make money</p>
<p class="body">And they they sell drugs and the drugs are often beneficial, but their main goal is to make money</p>
<p class="body">And if they can fudge the data if they can move the numbers around</p>

<p class="body">It is a cost benefit analysis in the Pharmaceutical industry about misbehavior</p>
<p class="body">They are not grounded in the ethical principles that you and I as average people believe in</p>
<p class="body">They don't live in that world as you appropriately point out</p>
<p class="body">They are about profit return on investment</p>
<p class="body">And furthermore 
<p class="body">The Overlords that own them</p>
<p class="body">BlackRock Vanguard State Street, et cetera</p>
<p class="body">These large, massive funds that are completely decoupled from nation states have no moral core</p>
<p class="body">They have no moral purpose</p>
<p class="body">Their only purpose is return on investment</p>
<p class="body">And that is the core problem here</p>
<p class="body">That, and the fact that we as a society have become grossly fragmented through social media, electronic appliances, the stress of what we've experienced</p>
<p class="body">And this leads into this whole issue of mass formation psychosis that Matias Desmond</p>
<p class="body">The University of Ghent has promoted</p>
<p class="body">That for many of us, when Matthias, you know, psychologist and statistician interesting combination, came made public</p>
<p class="body">A lot of us as we listen to Matthias, we said oh that makes sense, that that was like the brain, that what happened when I encountered the trusted news initiative, I said, oh, you know, I don't know if you saw the Brett Weinstein podcast with me and Steve Kirsch</p>
<p class="body">Where that lit this whole fire all over the world, Bret ends with the with the basically the question if you listen to the long version</p>
<p class="body">What's how does this happen? </p>
<p class="body">How how do we have this emergent phenomena? </p>
<p class="body">The how question right? </p>
<p class="body">And you know behind the how question is the why question? </p>
<p class="body">That the</p>
<p class="body">The the how question of a third of the population basically being hypnotized</p>
<p class="body">In totally wrapped up in whatever Tony Fauci in the mainstream media feeds them whatever CNN tells them is true</p>
<p class="body">Let me illustrate that the other day I was looking through New York Times recent articles about Omicron and Pediatrics in preparation for this, and for making some slideshows</p>
<p class="body">And I saw this headline in the New York Times</p>
<p class="body">Epidemiologist in a vaccine ologist in the in the title was</p>
<p class="body">How you should think about children and omicron? </p>
<p class="body">It was, it was blatantly saying this is how you should think we're going to tell you how to think</p>
<p class="body">OK, people kind of gotta get that in their head</p>
<p class="body">That's the world we're in right now</p>
<p class="body">Now, what Matthias Desmond has has shared with us</p>
<p class="body">Brilliant Insight is another one of those aahe</p>
<p class="body">Now that</p>
<p class="body">Part makes sense</p>
<p class="body">Which is that? </p>
<p class="body">This comes from basically European intellectual inquiry into what the heck happened in Germany</p>
<p class="body">In the 20s and 30s, you know very intelligent, highly educated population and they went barking mad</p>
<p class="body">And how did that happen? </p>
<p class="body">The answer is mass formation psychosis</p>
<p class="body">When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other</p>
<p class="body">And has free floating anxiety in a sense that things don't make sense</p>
<p class="body">We can't understand it</p>
<p class="body">And then their attention gets focused by a leader or a series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis</p>
<p class="body">They literally become hypnotized and can be LED anywhere</p>
<p class="body">And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that they identify as their leaders</p>
<p class="body">The ones typically that come in and say you have this pain and I can solve it for you</p>
<p class="body">I and I alone</p>
<p class="body">OK, I can fix this problem for you</p>
<p class="body">OK then they will lead</p>
<p class="body">They will follow that person through hell</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter whether they lie to him or whatever</p>
<p class="body">The data are irrelevant, and furthermore anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked</p>
<p class="body">They are the other</p>
<p class="body">This is central to mass formation psychosis and this is what has happened. We had all those conditions. If you remember back before 2019, everybody was complaining. The world doesn't make sense</p>
<p class="body">Blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">And we're all isolated from each other</p>
<p class="body">We're all on our little tools</p>
<p class="body">We're not connected socially anymore except through social media</p>
<p class="body">And then this thing happened and everybody focused on it</p>
<p class="body">That is how mass formation psychosis happens</p>
<p class="body">And that is what's happened here</p>
<p class="body">Now there's ways to get out of it</p>
<p class="body">Matias recommendation is you've got to get people to realize that what we've got is a situation of</p>
<p class="body">Global totalitarianism 
<p class="body">In his experience in Europe</p>
<p class="body">Making people realize there's a bigger threat than the virus</p>
<p class="body">Can cause a separation psychologically</p>
<p class="body">In this fusion this hypnosis that has happened</p>
<p class="body">The problem is then you're just substituting a bigger boogeyman from the current one</p>
<p class="body">And somebody else can come in and manipulate that the real problem, and it gets back to your core point</p>
<p class="body">We're sick as a society and we have to heal ourselves</p>
<p class="body">And one of the things we have to do</p>
<p class="body">Is come together</p>
<p class="body">We have to recreate our social bonds</p>
<p class="body">We have to</p>
<p class="body">Buy into integrity</p>
<p class="body">The importance of human dignity</p>
<p class="body">And the importance of community</p>
<p class="body">That's how we get out of this</p>
<p class="body">And I think that this inside of Matias Desmond</p>
<p class="body">Is really central to kind of making sense out of all of this crazy</p>
<p class="body">We got a world in which the press is incentivized</p>
<p class="body">To push a storyline because they're all controlled by the same large funds</p>
<p class="body">That Pfizer is and so is tech</p>
<p class="body">I don't know how we're going to get out of it, but it's got to start with us</p>
<p class="body">All of us finding common ground</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think one way we're going to get out of it is by realizing what it is</p>
<p class="body">And by the way you just explained it in the way Peter McCullough explained it when he was on the podcast</p>
<p class="body">As well, this mass formation psychosis that we're currently experiencing</p>
<p class="body">Most people are unaware that's even happening</p>
<p class="body">All these events take place and it's this perfect storm</p>
<p class="body">Of the social media aspect of it, the the fact that we are disconnected the the COVID, the separation, the isolation from society, the lockdowns</p>
<p class="body">Also coming off of the four years of Trump where we're so polarized politically and this</p>
<p class="body">It's become</p>
<p class="body">Not just common but accepted to other people to to point at those the others</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's the Republicans or the Democrats or the independents</p>
<p class="body">Whatever you choose, whatever you choose to make, or the unvaccinated that was going to get to, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Or the OR the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's one of the things that</p>
<p class="body">I find very bizarre about the tribal aspect of this is that people want me to get vaccinated and like my friends who've been vaccinated, want me to join the team like go ahead, get the tattoo like what are you saying? </p>
<p class="body">And I'm like I've gone through the virus</p>
<p class="body">I have immunity</p>
<p class="body">I also have antibodies</p>
<p class="body">I just checked them last week like I could show you the test</p>
<p class="body">A matter of fact, I have it right here</p>
<p class="body">There it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And I had to be tested when I came in the front door at</p>
<p class="body">Your shop here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we test everybody, but the point being is it doesn't make any sense for me to get vaccinated</p>
<p class="body">But they want me to join</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's worse than that</p>
<p class="body">It puts you at higher risk</p>
<p class="body">Yes, OK, they're asking you to take more risk</p>
<p class="body">For your health</p>
<p class="body">In order to join their club</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's what it is, and that's what it is, and it's a it's a tribal formation</p>
<p class="body">It's people who don't have personal sovereignty and people who aren't confident with standing by their own thoughts and objectively analyzing things outside of, uh, an ideology outside of the tribe</p>
<p class="body">Those people are very susceptible right now, and those are more common than not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So Joe again, this is not me buttering you up</p>
<p class="body">This is, This is why you're providing such a service to your country and to humanity</p>
<p class="body">Because you're one of the few voices</p>
<p class="body">That has a an audience</p>
<p class="body">That is not Democrat or Republican or black or white, or vaccinated or unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">All these dipoles that we create artificially</p>
<p class="body">And you are trying to speak to that persuadable middle</p>
<p class="body">In and do so with with an open heart</p>
<p class="body">In an open mind</p>
<p class="body">And in a world in which all of the information is being so carefully manipulated</p>
<p class="body">And so pervasively distorted</p>
<p class="body">And and I, I'm grateful sincerely</p>
<p class="body">My colleagues are grateful</p>
<p class="body">And and I think the world should be grateful for your leadership</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I'm very grateful that there's courageous people like yourself that do put your reputations and your careers on the line by speaking out against this stuff when it is very difficult</p>
<p class="body">And when you do get deep platform for doing that, they know that by censoring you, they're not</p>
<p class="body">Just censoring you</p>
<p class="body">They're also making others like you</p>
<p class="body">Self censor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Absolutely absolutely</p>
<p class="body">I've been self censoring for months</p>
<p class="body">I mean every morning when we post on Twitter, my wife and I, Jill Glasspool Malone, PhD, right? </p>
<p class="body">I have this active</p>
<p class="body">Can we post this? </p>
<p class="body">Not you know how do we say this? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So we're not going to get deep platformed blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">We're constantly self censoring</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's crazy because you're self censoring about your area of expertise</p>
<p class="body">Which is insane because the people who are censoring you don't have any education in it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It yes, I agree it's insane</p>
<p class="body">It's the world we're in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm just hoping that that clip where you explained this mass formation psychosis makes the rounds and I think everything you've laid out today is about as clear and as rational and as well documented as</p>
<p class="body">I could have hoped and more so thank you very much for being here</p>
<p class="body">Thank you very much for everything that you've done and Jesus Christ Twitter</p>
<p class="body">Put the ******* guy back on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's OK, you know so</p>
<p class="body">So you do martial arts</p>
<p class="body">And so you get the idea of using your opponent's energy against</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Him yes, OK? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I was immediately contacted by multiple lawyers</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure this this could be an excellent exemplar case</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think it is between you and Alex Berenson</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Who's already filed one? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, OK, I've I've been through the legal grind</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to sue anybody frankly, but it is</p>
<p class="body">It just sucks the blood out of you</p>
<p class="body">Not to mention your financial resources</p>
<p class="body">I mean it's just a ugly process</p>
<p class="body">I hate it</p>
<p class="body">There's two hills that are willing</p>
<p class="body">I'm willing to die on</p>
<p class="body">One is stopping the jabs and the children</p>
<p class="body">And one is</p>
<p class="body">You know, resisting</p>
<p class="body">The erosion of free speech</p>
<p class="body">Which is the fundamental principle on which our democracy and our society civilized Western culture is built on? </p>
<p class="body">I like to say when I give rallies do you remember back a couple of years ago when you felt sorry for the people in the People's Republic of China? </p>
<p class="body">Their Internet was filtered</p>
<p class="body">They weren't allowed free speech</p>
<p class="body">Their government told them what to do and think</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">Now here we are</p>
<p class="body">OK, and the next thing that we all feel sorry about social credit system</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">Wake up folks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wake up it's coming</p>
<p class="body">If we give into this and we give into vaccine passports and having an app on your phone that shows everything you're doing in in terms of your medical history, and they've even offered people extra credit, there was a article on Yahoo about having access to your browser history and they they framed it in this very positive way that having access to your browser in history may</p>
<p class="body">Allow you to receive extra credit</p>
<p class="body">So you would be available you would you</p>
<p class="body">You would have credit available to buy a home or a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Car so bingo OK we already know what social credit systems feel like</p>
<p class="body">We call it a credit rating agencies, OK? </p>
<p class="body">And you know what? </p>
<p class="body">Those guys do</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter whether or not if it's on, your record doesn't matter whether or not you did it or what the extenuating circumstances were, it's in their algorithm and you will get your score and your score basically will determine the tax on your access to credit in the form of the interest that you pay on the money that</p>
<p class="body">They have been given by the federal government</p>
<p class="body">OK, that's the way this ecosystem works</p>
<p class="body">They get that money at a huge discount and then they decide how worthy you are to receive it</p>
<p class="body">If you want to have credit</p>
<p class="body">And so if you want to understand a little tiny version of the social credit system, it's right there in your credit score</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think the only thing that helps us here is that this may be the one subject where</p>
<p class="body">Everyone loses people on the left</p>
<p class="body">People on the right, people in the center, everyone loses if they impart a social credit system</p>
<p class="body">If there is some sort of social credit app that you have to carry around on your phone that determines where you're allowed to go, what you're allowed to do, we're all gonna lose, no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I disagree</p>
<p class="body">The oligarchs win</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A very small percentage of the population wins</p>
<p class="body">Yes, right? </p>
<p class="body">But I mean the the general public, the people, the people that are divided about COVID the people that are now othering each other and you know you losers who got the jab and look at you</p>
<p class="body">Unvaccinated playgrounds</p>
<p class="body">This nonsense is going on</p>
<p class="body">Maybe this will be the one thing that unites us 'cause we realize that this</p>
<p class="body">Is tyranny, or if it won't come? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Welcome to the new boss</p>
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">Welcome to the new Overlords guys</p>
<p class="body">And it's your choice I'm I'm gonna be dead</p>
<p class="body">You know I'm I'm 62</p>
<p class="body">It's it's my thanks, you're kind</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You got some years in you bro</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That it's our children</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Settle in it's</p>
<p class="body">I mean, they're</p>
<p class="body">There's they're challenged uniquely already because they are growing up with social media</p>
<p class="body">They're growing up with Tik T.O.K and these invasive apps that are tracking all their movement and everything they do and buy and see and what they look up and they cross platform</p>
<p class="body">They they share this data across platform</p>
<p class="body">It's very sketchy stuff and that the fact that it's happened and it happened so quickly and that our data which seemed to be nothing became one of the most valuable commodities in the world</p>
<p class="body">And that and that data is used to manipulate</p>
<p class="body">All the people on the planet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So we're touching on some deep stuff about the kids and I'm forgive me for an unabashed</p>
<p class="body">For the Unity project, which I serve as chief medical and regulatory officer for so that's</p>
<p class="body">Unity project online</p>
<p class="body">Com or org it's com</p>
<p class="body">We're totally focused on the kids</p>
<p class="body">And if you go on that site</p>
<p class="body">You'll see a podcast that I did with a pediatric</p>
<p class="body">Psychiatrist out of LA</p>
<p class="body">And a pediatric</p>
<p class="body">Cardiologist who's also a pH</p>
<p class="body">D in vascular inflammation, Kurt milhoan</p>
<p class="body">And I got those two guys on to talk about what's happening to our children</p>
<p class="body">In particular</p>
<p class="body">The psychological damage</p>
<p class="body">Of these lockdowns this mask use</p>
<p class="body">The school policies</p>
<p class="body">The bullying of children who are unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">The psychological damage is huge</p>
<p class="body">We're having a worldwide epidemic of suicide in children</p>
<p class="body">We are having a huge surge of drug abuse in adolescents</p>
<p class="body">We're having demonstrable drops in IQ and fundamental developmental milestones</p>
<p class="body">In the very young</p>
<p class="body">Like 20 IQ points</p>
<p class="body">OK, children have to see faces to learn how to speak and to interact socially</p>
<p class="body">You're talking about social intelligence, which you're deep in</p>
<p class="body">And connectedness we're raising a generation of children in that have been blocked from their ability because their brains are developing extremely rapidly at this age</p>
<p class="body">The ability for their brains to assimilate the information necessary for them to become functional citizens</p>
<p class="body">And parents</p>
<p class="body">We're destroying it without a second thought</p>
<p class="body">And the damage is going to last for generations and</p>
<p class="body">Is if that's not bad enough, we're allowing the state to insert itself into the family</p>
<p class="body">And make decisions by mandating vaccination</p>
<p class="body">OK, This is why this these childhood vaccines mandates are obscene</p>
<p class="body">We're setting up a situation in which children are going to see peers who have been vaccine damaged as a consequence of the policies that their teachers and their government have forced on them</p>
<p class="body">The the damage here</p>
<p class="body">Is going to be with us for generations</p>
<p class="body">I'm not being chicken little here</p>
<p class="body">This is deep, profound stuff</p>
<p class="body">It's way beyond myocarditis</p>
<p class="body">In no one seems to care</p>
<p class="body">No one talks to children</p>
<p class="body">There was a big breakthrough</p>
<p class="body">We all celebrated a week ago, Face the Nation</p>
<p class="body">What on the on the annual Roundup of of stories that have been underreported? </p>
<p class="body">One of the speakers got up journalists and and said to the other group, I think one of the most underreported stories has been the damage that's happened to our children</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I saw that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And did you see what happened with the other journalists? </p>
<p class="body">Nobody said a word</p>
<p class="body">They moved on</p>
<p class="body">It was hardly covered in media</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, she even glossed over the damage by the vaccines</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Agreed, how she? </p>
<p class="body">How could she speak about the vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">I suspect she may lose her job</p>
<p class="body">She's not gonna be invited back on that program again</p>
<p class="body">I doubt</p>
<p class="body">I mean, how could she speak about the damage of the vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">It is already</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">She did she really just briefly touched</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">On this and she</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so so</p>
<p class="body">Probably 'cause it's dangerous, insanely dangerous to speak truth to power right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Before we wrap this up, why is the vaccine uniquely dangerous to children? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Good question that the and I'm not completely so</p>
<p class="body">The data</p>
<p class="body">Here's the problem with the myocarditis bias in children in</p>
<p class="body">The data set, particularly boys</p>
<p class="body">One of the things there is clearly an androgen component to the risk of both the vaccine and the disease of the the virus</p>
<p class="body">And that's why anti androgens, by the way Pierre Corey shout out to him for a champion of anti androgens, androgens being added to his math plus protocol</p>
<p class="body">OK, particularly for men</p>
<p class="body">Why are boys there? </p>
<p class="body">There's probably a component of that that has to do with an artifact in the data</p>
<p class="body">That being that, when a sold coudures in general, is a population have a much higher risk of cardiac events, and so if there's a heart attack in in one of us</p>
<p class="body">It's really hard to say</p>
<p class="body">Is it just because we're old? </p>
<p class="body">Or is it a vaccine related? </p>
<p class="body">OK, so then the vaccine if there are vaccine related events buried in that</p>
<p class="body">We're not going to see him statistically</p>
<p class="body">It's really hard to pull it out, whereas kids don't have heart attacks and they don't have strokes, so you can see those things really clearly against the background of virtually nothing, so that's it may be partially an artifact of reporting and bias because of confounding variables, and it may be there</p>
<p class="body">Other effects</p>
<p class="body">In terms of your broader question, moving outside of the myocarditis, why are children more susceptible to these adverse events? </p>
<p class="body">I think they're not</p>
<p class="body">I think the problem is that we're seeing it in the kids, but it's present in the adult population also</p>
<p class="body">I think there is a significant reporting bias going on against reporting adult vaccine injury</p>
<p class="body">I think that we have more in in how why would I say that? </p>
<p class="body">Oh, because I'm a vaccine denier</p>
<p class="body">I'm a bad guy and I have some perverse incentive to have that media hit me know we have these reports from hospitalists and nurses, the ones that often it's the nurses</p>
<p class="body">They're able to speak for some reason</p>
<p class="body">The nurses are disclosing things that they're seeing in their hospitals, and the physicians are all shutting up</p>
<p class="body">Is it because they have financial incentives or because they're all owned because they have such debt burdens? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">But the nurses are speaking out and they're saying, hey, we're seeing strokes and heart attacks in these other types of problems that are known to be associated with the jabs</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's hard to say</p>
<p class="body">Because we got the virus in the in</p>
<p class="body">The vaccines overlapping, you know, is it chicken or egg? </p>
<p class="body">We know that they're happening</p>
<p class="body">We know that the deaths are happening</p>
<p class="body">That's like the the</p>
<p class="body">Excuses that are made about the sudden deaths in high performing athletes</p>
<p class="body">That are being observed all over the world, particularly in footballers</p>
<p class="body">That where they're just suddenly dropping, is it because they've been infected or they because they've been jabbed? </p>
<p class="body">In and I think it's a mixture of both</p>
<p class="body">But if it's from the vaccines, the thing about the vaccines is that's in, you know we have this principle we used to</p>
<p class="body">Of do no harm</p>
<p class="body">In in</p>
<p class="body">If a if a virus naturally infects you and you have a damage from it, I haven't caused that damage as a physician</p>
<p class="body">If I'm recommending that you take a drug</p>
<p class="body">An intervention they didn't need to have</p>
<p class="body">You may or may not have gotten infected, and it causes damage</p>
<p class="body">Well, I got to kind of own that</p>
<p class="body">As a physician, as a representative of the medical industrial complex and a participant in it</p>
<p class="body">And so</p>
<p class="body">For whatever reason, there's an underreporting bias</p>
<p class="body">Clearly, in the adult population</p>
<p class="body">And I think that people be me a little more sensitive to adverse events and deaths in their children</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Robert, thank you for everything</p>
<p class="body">I really appreciate you</p>
<p class="body">I appreciate you being here</p>
<p class="body">If people want to read more of your work now that you've been banned from Twitter, where are you? </p>
<p class="body">Where are you? </p>
<p class="body">Are you still on LinkedIn or you gone? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">From LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">Still on LinkedIn I'm I'm really cautious on LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">I'm like I'm on getter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sub stack</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And I'm on sub stack, so that's RW Malone, MD</p>
<p class="body">And who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sub stacks probably the best place though, right? </p>
<p class="body">The least censored</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's the the problem with sub stack</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it is least censored and and I would love more sub stack subscriptions, but I have a financial conflict of interest there so I don't want to pump it</p>
<p class="body">But that is I try to use sub stack for more in depth intellectual pieces</p>
<p class="body">Thought pieces, not just I mean Alex bless his heart</p>
<p class="body">He blasts everything out as if sub stack is Twitter</p>
<p class="body">It's not my style, right? </p>
<p class="body">So I'm going to be using getter for that thread getter</p>

<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a that's a Twitter alternative</p>
<p class="body">We don't know about getter</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, no, it's it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Been waiting for one though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yep, so I'm using getter and and again at at RW Malone, MD</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So is it? </p>
<p class="body">Is it spelled like? </p>
<p class="body">GTR GT GTR</p>
<p class="body">Do you want it, Jamie, no GTR</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so getter is is branded as the Twitter killer</p>
<p class="body">It is explicitly a Twitter alternative</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it all right wing crazy people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's it's a lot</p>
<p class="body">It's a lot of people that have been, it's yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That a lot of people that kicked</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it started off</p>
<p class="body">It's yeah, it's it's</p>
<p class="body">It's weird, you know</p>
<p class="body">They are committed to not censoring beautiful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I support that entirely</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I just did</p>
<p class="body">There's a problem with some of these that they do get infected by people that were shitposters</p>
<p class="body">You know, with shitposters are people just yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, I've I've been on social media a</p>
<p class="body">Long time</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure I used to be on Yahoo stock chat boards</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's kind of where I cut my teeth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, Robert, thank you very much</p>
<p class="body">Just thank you for everything and I hope this</p>
<p class="body">I hope this helps</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you, thanks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We really do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So seriously</p>
<p class="body">Thank you for your service</p>
<p class="body">To your nation and to the world</p>
<p class="body">Mr Rogan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">My pleasure, thank you. Thanks for everything. Bye everybody. So folks we we actually went outside and talked and Robert realized that he had forgotten to tell everybody about this rally. And then I picked up Snoop who's with me now. So there is a rally January 23rd</p>
<p class="body">Where is it you wanna give us the? </p>
<p class="body">Details why shouldn't? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Motion in DC between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. So this is the defeat the mandates an American homecoming rally and thanks a lot for letting me put the plug in. The website is www.defeatthemandatesdc.com</p>
<p class="body">So this is not about being anti vaccines, it's about being anti mandates and our hope is that we bring people together</p>
<p class="body">I know that's one of your core messages</p>
<p class="body">People from every walk of life, every party, every religion, every ethnic background</p>
<p class="body">Democrat Republican vaccinated unvaccinated the thing that we can agree on is personal liberty and the right of people to make their own choice</p>
<p class="body">And that's what this rally is about, is to resist these mandates of the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Whether you believe in it or don't believe in it</p>
<p class="body">I hope that you believe in the integrity and freedom of your fellow man and woman to make their own bodily choices</p>
<p class="body">So this is going to be part of a same day worldwide rally for freedom that's going to come across the entire world</p>
<p class="body">This is in Australia, in Europe, in UK</p>
<p class="body">And in the United States, for the first time</p>
<p class="body">So we ask that you join us, we're we're asking our our objective is to end the vaccine mandates and also no vaccine passports</p>
<p class="body">No vaccination for healthy children, no to censorship, no to limits on reasonable debate</p>
<p class="body">In this censorship and and propaganda that we're constantly bombarded with, we believe in the power of natural immunity</p>
<p class="body">We believe and insist on informed consent, and we insist on allowing doctors and patients making decisions without interference together</p>
<p class="body">So, Joe thank you for allowing me to correct my grievous</p>
<p class="body">Error here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No worries, we realized it. So one more time with the website itsdefeatthemandates.com</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's</p>
<p class="body">Feet the mandates D c.com and you can find all the information. January 23rd. It's a Sunday join not just with people in the United States, but from all over the world for our common good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Beautiful thank you</p>
<p class="body">Thanks again everyone bye</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that must prove that hydroxy and diver mekton protect well</p>
<p class="body">Well, not so</p>
<p class="body">As you point out, there's a lot of moving parts here, and so This is why you know, I'm glad you didn't ask me</p>
<p class="body">Well, why is that Robert? </p>
<p class="body">Because I would have said I can't say because there's too many confounding variables</p>
<p class="body">However, it is a fascinating observation</p>
<p class="body">That we have this intensively vaccinated cohort in Israel, and in much, much less vaccinated cohorts in the surrounding states</p>
<p class="body">And you can look it up on worldometers</p>
<p class="body">You don't have to believe me, you know your audience is smart enough</p>
<p class="body">They can go on</p>
<p class="body">Roadometer and look it up and look at the mortality and morbidity in these different countries and figure it out for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Themselves is the rate of infection comparable? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Hart, you know, rate of infection is a really hard variable because it's a function of the density of testing</p>
<p class="body">And so you know, this is one of those situations</p>
<p class="body">The more you look for it</p>
<p class="body">The more 
<p class="body">You find, which is why you really can't use that as a denominator</p>
<p class="body">Is the incidence of infection because the incidence of infection is totally contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing? </p>
<p class="body">So you have to rely on things</p>
<p class="body">That's the only really the only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all of this bias</p>
<p class="body">That's all over in the system except in a few states</p>
<p class="body">The Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data</p>
<p class="body">The UK to some extent has cleaner data</p>
<p class="body">It's now clear that the Israeli data set is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of which it's deleted, but the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all 'cause mortality</p>
<p class="body">So because people get kind of wrapped up around this and they say, well, you know that that these vaccine these deaths that were</p>
<p class="body">I mean, this is the</p>
<p class="body">Everybody argues both sides of the coin with their system</p>
<p class="body">Oh, that means nothing and then Oh well, in the CDC uses it, it means everything, right? </p>
<p class="body">And and it's OK for them to use it in the numerator, but it's not OK for anybody else</p>
<p class="body">To use it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And for people don't know we're talking about, we're talking about the vaccine adverse event reporting system that's fares</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Which which the FDA explicitly said in the licensure packet for commodity is inadequate detect rare to detect rare adverse events</p>
<p class="body">That's why they forced</p>
<p class="body">If if they ever market commodity in the United States are going to have to do a bunch of clinical trials, which I think is one reason why they're not doing it because the FDA has told him that VAERS is basically junk</p>
<p class="body">But it's the best we got</p>
<p class="body">OK, so you know when you when you look at these ratios you the argument as well</p>
<p class="body">Just because somebody died within X number of days of receipt of vaccine, it doesn't mean their death is vaccine caused it's vaccine correlated, that's fair</p>
<p class="body">But it's the only variable we have and it's consistent in that we've had that variable in that outcome measure for decades</p>
<p class="body">OK, so then we can look at trends, but what we see is this explosion of vaccine associated deaths</p>
<p class="body">And you and to kind of pick that apart</p>
<p class="body">People say you know well, if you had a car accident or a bullet to the head</p>
<p class="body">And you went to the hospital and they tested you with a PCR test that's non specific and they rented up to 42 cycles and they said, oh look, there's the virus by the way, they have a financial incentive to do that</p>
<p class="body">That results in a false positive death, true</p>
<p class="body">But the other side of the coin is that if somebody is having brain fog or they have a stroke while they're driving a car</p>
<p class="body">And they crash and die</p>
<p class="body">And they've had it within, you know, 48 hours of when they took the jab, and we know the jabs cause blood clotting and strokes. Well then it could well be that an auto accident is vaccine related</p>
<p class="body">Catch my point so</p>
<p class="body">So all of these kind of things you can't sort out what what's what</p>
<p class="body">You just kind of have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it contracts corrects for all that stuff</p>
<p class="body">All that noise that's inherent in the system</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a COVID death</p>
<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<p class="body">What is the financial incentive? </p>
'cause there's all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid for COVID death and that the government gives them money and that they're incentivized to make something</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So there's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Mark it down, it's not</p>
<p class="body">Rumors it's not rumors but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Now I don't have the specific numbers at the top of my head</p>
<p class="body">I'm not a hospitalist</p>
<p class="body">I'm not a hospital administrator</p>
<p class="body">But the the numbers are quite large. There's something like a $3000 basically death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be COVID, there's a financial incentive to call somebody COVID positive</p>
<p class="body">The CDC made a determination in year one</p>
<p class="body">This is why all of our baseline data is junk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is the financial incentive to say that they're COVID positive? </p>
<p class="body">That's why the PCR cycles are ramped up so high</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I I I again, you're asking causation I I can tell you that there the hospitals receive a bonus from the government</p>
<p class="body">I think it's like 3000 bucks</p>
<p class="body">If someone is hospitalized and able to be declared COVID positive</p>
<p class="body">They also receive a bonus</p>
<p class="body">I think the total is something like 30,000 in incentive. If somebody gets put on the event</p>
<p class="body">Then they get a bonus if somebody is declared dead with COVID</p>
<p class="body">COVID OK, so they have an incentive at the front end to declare somebody COVID a COVID case</p>
<p class="body">The CDC made the determination that they they were going to make a core assumption if PCR positive</p>
<p class="body">And you die</p>
<p class="body">That is death due to COVID</p>
<p class="body">And so the the extreme example, just to to show the absurdity</p>
<p class="body">If the patient comes in with a bullet hole of the head</p>
<p class="body">And they do a nose swab and they come up PCR positive</p>
<p class="body">They're determined to have died from COVID, when in fact they died from lead poisoning, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that real? That's real</p>
<p class="body">That's real, yeah</p>
<p class="body">So they've really done that with gunshot victims car accident victims</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know about</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, for for sure</p>
<p class="body">Trauma and other things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I've seen that said</p>
<p class="body">But I've always thought that's ridiculous there's</p>
<p class="body">No way of hospital would do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's not</p>
<p class="body">It's not the, it's not a question of what hospital would do, it's a question of Med codes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So the code is set that if you swab that person and you are, you're supposed to swab them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And and you</p>
<p class="body">Get a positive signal</p>
<p class="body">And the person</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Are you obligated to swap them no matter who they are? </p>
<p class="body">If they come in with an injury? </p>
<p class="body">So that it really is true that if someone has a gunshot wound and they're dying of that gunshot wound and you checked them for COVID, and if they're COVID positive and they die, they marked it off as a COVID death</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is, uh, that is by definition from the CDC</p>
<p class="body">That was a decision that was made early on</p>
<p class="body">There is that there is</p>
<p class="body">That's why so many of us are so much in arms</p>
<p class="body">Up in arms and and really pretty aggravated about what's going on</p>
<p class="body">All the way through this, the information let me put it this way</p>
<p class="body">Joe part of the reason I know you're somebody who is really committed to to bringing everybody together</p>
<p class="body">And the idea that we're really one America</p>
<p class="body">We're one people</p>
<p class="body">We shouldn't be divided like this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'd like that for the whole world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Amen yeah Amen</p>
<p class="body">OK, we're aligned</p>
<p class="body">We're just humans</p>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<p class="body">OK, but but we've been divided in this way in and it's all been politicized</p>
<p class="body">And the data have been so thoroughly manipulated</p>
<p class="body">That it's hard for any of us to make sense out of it, and all the way through</p>
<p class="body">Our government, at least</p>
<p class="body">I can't speak to Great Britain or the Germany, but our government has had a series of checkpoints where they have a job to do and I know this because is what I do for a living</p>
<p class="body">Right, I do regulatory affairs and clinical development</p>
<p class="body">We wouldn't be having all of this conflict about what is truth if the FDA had done its job</p>
<p class="body">What the FDA didn't do was force the pharmaceutical manufacturers to do their job</p>
<p class="body">Now we can</p>
<p class="body">We can wrap around, you know</p>
<p class="body">Well, maybe it was just they were all in a rush</p>
<p class="body">We were all panicked, blah blah blah blah blah, but the bottom line was they didn't do their job</p>
<p class="body">And they didn't force pharma to do its job</p>
<p class="body">And they didn't employ the standard requirements for testing and verification that pharma was doing its job</p>
<p class="body">That I would expect to experience as a clinical researcher on one of my studies</p>
<p class="body">OK, what's going on with Pfizer? </p>
<p class="body">If the whistleblower comments hold true</p>
<p class="body">And for instance, the Madita Gary case, this young woman who is listed as having a stomach ache that participated in the Pfizer trials, when in fact what she had was a seizure</p>
<p class="body">And she's now we'll bond wheelchair bound with a nasal gastric tube</p>
<p class="body">One of 1000 subjects</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is a 13 year old girl, right</p>
<p class="body">That was a part of the study and they wrote it down as what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Gastric distress 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's that's literally what it says in terms of the adverse effect</p>
<p class="body">Gastric distress, like what? </p>
<p class="body">What is gastric distress? </p>
<p class="body">Stomach ache, that's it</p>
<p class="body">But what? </p>
<p class="body">How do they account for all the other injuries? </p>
<p class="body">They don't</p>
<p class="body">They don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">They take her off of the study</p>
<p class="body">They they take</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How is? </p>
<p class="body">Her possible</p>
<p class="body">That that's totally unethical, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It is it is, it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So who's signing off on that? </p>
<p class="body">How do they? </p>
<p class="body">How are they? </p>
<p class="body">Allowed to do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So the way the rules work in regulatory affairs, so this is law, right? </p>
<p class="body">This is regulatory affairs law in common practice at the FDA, and globally there's all kinds of</p>
<p class="body">Treaties and things that regulate how these things are supposed to be done</p>
<p class="body">The rule is used to be that a pharmaceutical company could kind of offload all the liability for bad stuff that might happen in a clinical trial and be mismanaged, etc onto the performer or the subcontractor used to be that pharma actually did the trials themselves, and then they found it was cheaper, more efficient, and they could push off their liability</p>
<p class="body">If they engaged companies like I've been working for for decades, contract research organizations, clinical contract research organizations</p>
<p class="body">And so that was done for a while, and if anything bad went bad in the trial</p>
<p class="body">Then the farmer could say, oh, it wasn't us</p>
<p class="body">It was those guys</p>
<p class="body">Over the last few years, the FDA got wise to that, and they made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor</p>
<p class="body">That's fancy regulatory speak for its pharma</p>
<p class="body">Owns it</p>
<p class="body">OK, so you asked the question</p>
<p class="body">Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? </p>
<p class="body">The answer is Pfizer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So they're responsible for the data they're allowed to say that this was just some sort of a gastric distress</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And the job of the FDA always</p>
<p class="body">Is to ferret out monkey business which happens all the time</p>
<p class="body">Whether intentional or unintentional</p>
<p class="body">And there's all kinds of ways you can craft clinical trials</p>
<p class="body">And craft clinical trial study reports, final study reports to hide the bad stuff and highlight the good stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So in this clinical trial that this young lady was involved in, how many children were involved in this study? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's 2000, approximately, but they're split into placebo and experimental groups, and so she was in the treatment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Group now one of the things that people have said in response to the vaccine injuries, is that it's</p>
<p class="body">Approximately 1 in 1000 that are getting these significant injuries like myocarditis and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So you think there's there's a well? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's warm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's important when we talk about these things</p>
<p class="body">To make a distinction between an event that is clinically significant</p>
<p class="body">And might result in hospitalization</p>
<p class="body">Versus something that might be undetected</p>
<p class="body">Unless you did a laboratory test</p>
<p class="body">Or you know, maybe like for instance myself, when I started to experience those things that I experienced after Moderna</p>
<p class="body">I was confused it was not listed as among the side effects</p>
<p class="body">I thought I'd just suddenly developed rampant hypertension</p>
<p class="body">Until the data started coming out and I, you know, fortunately I had an astute cardiologist that got me under control and got me under medical management</p>
<p class="body">And then I looked into it</p>
<p class="body">Oh, this is one of the known side effects</p>
<p class="body">And then time went by and it became more and more clear</p>
<p class="body">So the point is that what gets reported in a study? </p>
<p class="body">Is often biased by how the study is structured</p>
<p class="body">Because one lists when you when you write the study protocol, you list expected adverse events</p>
<p class="body">And so people, if those things happen, oftentimes they get checked</p>
<p class="body">But I guarantee one of the expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis</p>
<p class="body">OK, now what? </p>
<p class="body">They did? </p>
<p class="body">One of the things there's all kinds of tricks you can play with the data if you if you're so inclined</p>
<p class="body">And that's why it's so important</p>
<p class="body">People like me that do clinical research for a living</p>
<p class="body">We get drummed into our head bioethics on a regular basis</p>
<p class="body">It's obligatory training and we have to be retrained all the time</p>
<p class="body">So that 'cause this long history of physicians doing bad stuff, monkey business, and the most notable, of course in</p>
<p class="body">Common knowledge is the Tuskegee experiments, but 
<p class="body">So it happens</p>
<p class="body">There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff</p>
<p class="body">Makes the sponsor happy</p>
<p class="body">And then you get another contract</p>
<p class="body">These are not little contracts</p>
<p class="body">You know a modest clinical trial is $20 million</p>
<p class="body">A big one is 100,000,000 or more</p>
<p class="body">OK, so these are big money deals</p>
<p class="body">You want to keep that money flowing and you want to keep your sponsor happy</p>
<p class="body">So that's what's come out with the whistleblower with Pfizer</p>
<p class="body">Appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways</p>
<p class="body">And and this is done at the level of of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database and whether or not, well, if somebody had an adverse event after shot one and then they're dropped because they won't take shot two, you know, do we drop them out of this? </p>
<p class="body">Overall study analysis</p>
<p class="body">That's why there's there's we have all this specific language that we use in our business</p>
<p class="body">The intent to treat</p>
<p class="body">Cohort the PER protocol cohort</p>
<p class="body">These are separate analysis</p>
<p class="body">They describe these differences in how? </p>
<p class="body">Because it's known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways, and it's clear now and basically this was the subject by the way, just to bring it back around to our first topic</p>
<p class="body">This is the subject of that</p>
<p class="body">On presentation</p>
<p class="body">That the Canadians put out</p>
<p class="body">That I put in that Twitter post was all the different ways that the Pfizer data was manipulated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's just it blows my mind that that's the number one platform for distributing information right now, and that things like that are happening there</p>
'cause it is</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's it's essentially a number one that would end Facebook</p>
<p class="body">I don't know which one is bigger, but for distributing information</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So what's recently taken place so? </p>
<p class="body">So remember, looping back</p>
<p class="body">I talked about the interconnectedness at the board level between Pfizer and Thomson Reuters</p>
<p class="body">Yes, OK, Thomson Reuters has become the does</p>
<p class="body">The fact checker of choice for determining you know I quote fact checker right, and we know we so we can go into the</p>
<p class="body">To the Facebook lawsuit that recently broke that whole story open, but Thomson Reuters is tide to Pfizer</p>
<p class="body">They have common corporate ownership</p>
<p class="body">And they are the fact checker of Twitter</p>
<p class="body">Now they're integrated</p>
<p class="body">OK, so it's it's Thomson Reuters is making the decision</p>
<p class="body">Which has connections to Pfizer? </p>
<p class="body">About what information will be allowed to be discussed on Twitter? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is crazy</p>
<p class="body">It is so crazy to even hear</p>
<p class="body">I I and I don't know how we ever pull out of this mess. I mean I think we are at a 45 degree downward angle headed into a mountain</p>
<p class="body">I really do</p>
<p class="body">It's it's so strange to me that no one is up in arms about this other than the few people that have been censored and few people that have these opposing viewpoints that are, you know, deemed to be</p>
<p class="body">Something that can't be discussed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's it's Joe</p>
<p class="body">It's even deeper than that</p>
<p class="body">OK, then there's the hunting of physicians</p>
<p class="body">So I myself, you know, Peter McCullough is the textbook example of hunting physicians, right? The guy is 150 hundred 50,000 in debt right now in the hole. In trying to defend his medical license</p>
<p class="body">This is one of the most highly published authors</p>
<p class="body">In the world</p>
<p class="body">He's an exceptional researcher</p>
<p class="body">You know, and and apparently a pretty good podcast or two based on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Great, I mean, the guy's published more in his field than any other physician in history</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And Baylor is trying to take him out, and it's not only Baylor, it's some entity outside of Baylor that's come in and is financing the attacks on him</p>
<p class="body">But just to bring it home in a really not to make it all about me, but to be able to speak in the first person</p>
<p class="body">OK so I went to Maui with a bunch of physicians a few months ago and we gave talks and did training about early treatments</p>
<p class="body">We didn't talk about vaccines</p>
<p class="body">There's only one hospital on Maui in the island of Maui</p>
<p class="body">It's owned by a It's A P cyclea Kaiser Permanente satellite</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So we went there</p>
<p class="body">We gave that talk</p>
<p class="body">That hospital and the hospital is associated with it, are actively involved, and have kicked out Kirk Milhoan</p>
<p class="body">Because he's giving early treatment with the horse drug I ever met him</p>
<p class="body">OK now who is Kurt Milltown? </p>
<p class="body">You know why is he? </p>
<p class="body">Why is he in this hospital? </p>
<p class="body">What is he qualified? </p>
<p class="body">OK, he's an MD pH D pediatric cardiologist with his pH D training at UC San Diego in vascular inflammation</p>
<p class="body">He is among the most qualified individuals in the world for managing</p>
<p class="body">COVID and commenting on cardio myocarditis in children</p>
<p class="body">And they've kicked him out of</p>
<p class="body">The hospital</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just for prescribing ivory</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">For early treatment</p>
<p class="body">OK, he also happens to be a pastor at a local congregation</p>
<p class="body">He runs a food bank, he's whole life</p>
<p class="body">He has traveled to emerging economies to provide free treatment</p>
<p class="body">This is the kind of exemplar person that you know we all</p>
<p class="body">We all should be in in the best of all possible worlds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And did they give an excuse for this? </p>
<p class="body">Are they saying that his prescription of early treatment promotes vaccine hesitancy? </p>
<p class="body">Like, is there anything? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">He's he's prescribing</p>
<p class="body">Ineffective drugs and putting people's lives at risk. But here's the point</p>
<p class="body">I'm not even there yet</p>
<p class="body">OK, we're just winding up on this one</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So the other day, right before Christmas, three days before Christmas, I get a package</p>
<p class="body">From my licensing agency, which I'm licensed through the state of Maryland, so the state of Maryland Medical Board sends me a package</p>
<p class="body">And it is a complaint that's been filed against me</p>
<p class="body">I have six days to respond</p>
<p class="body">Basically I end up having to respond in Christmas Day</p>
<p class="body">OK or or earlier? </p>
<p class="body">To this attack, claiming that I should lose my medical license and the citations are that I didn't actually invent M RNA vaccines</p>
<p class="body">The a copy of the Atlantic Monthly attack article on me</p>
<p class="body">Claims that I'm licensed in Virginia, which I'm not</p>
<p class="body">Claims that I didn't graduate from Harvard Medical School, which I did</p>
<p class="body">OK so I have to respond to all this stuff now</p>
<p class="body">In going through it</p>
<p class="body">And and it's just false, false, false, false</p>
<p class="body">All coming in and pulled a bunch of stuff off of Twitter</p>
<p class="body">And LinkedIn and sent it in and saying, well, this is the reason why this guy should lose his license</p>
<p class="body">OK, because he is responsible for millions of deaths</p>
<p class="body">He said it straight out</p>
<p class="body">OK, I'm responsible for millions of deaths because of what I've said on social media</p>
<p class="body">Now, who is it that's filing this? </p>
<p class="body">It turns out it's the director</p>
<p class="body">Of recruitment in external affairs</p>
<p class="body">Of this hospital in Maui</p>
<p class="body">This guy felt that it was necessary to to send this little package of happiness right before Christmas to my licensing board to try to get my license taken away</p>
<p class="body">That what we're seeing across the United States and across the world</p>
<p class="body">Is it's the hospitals and the hospitals? </p>
<p class="body">Littles in the hospitalists</p>
<p class="body">That are attacking outside physicians</p>
<p class="body">That are attacking outside physicians</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you have any knowledge as to why they're doing this? </p>
<p class="body">Other than speculation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">If I was to follow the money, I'm going to put it that way</p>
<p class="body">OK again, I can't get into their heads</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know what's making them do this</p>
<p class="body">It's crazy OK, never been done before</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">It's happening, you know</p>
<p class="body">We went and did a presentation in Alaska and the same thing was being done for the physicians that came out and spoke about early treatment in Alaska and the</p>
<p class="body">Fortunately, the Alaska Licensing Board put out a very terse statement that they don't want to get involved in politics in this kind of *** for tat, and that this is outside of of their role medical licensing boards for this kind of stuff are usually involved in making determinations about somebody suitability because of drug abuse</p>
<p class="body">Or sexual activity or other things which are outside or malpractice</p>
<p class="body">Overt malpractice OK, this kind of political weaponization of medical licensing boards is new now</p>
<p class="body">Here's the here's the the observation that I can make if we follow the money</p>
<p class="body">Is that hospitals are incentivized to treat COVID patients</p>
<p class="body">The thing that ties all this little part of this story together, including the suppression through the government</p>
<p class="body">Of early treatment, hospitals are incentivized financially to treat COVID patients</p>
<p class="body">If COVID patients are being treated outside of the hospital and prevented from going to the hospital</p>
<p class="body">Such is the case in the Imperial Valley</p>
<p class="body">Where Brian Tyson? </p>
<p class="body">George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos that are coming across the border and working the fields</p>
<p class="body">I mean, they're they're breaking their backs to save the poor amazing story there with early treatments</p>
<p class="body">And I guess they're left alone because they're in the Imperial Valley</p>
<p class="body">Nobody cares</p>
<p class="body">They're all poor, but in these? </p>
<p class="body">Urban environments there are all these incentives for hospitals</p>
<p class="body">To treat COVID patients, and if people are giving treatments that are keeping those people out of hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So your speculation, if I just</p>
<p class="body">Could unpack this that doctor in Maui who was giving</p>
<p class="body">Early treatment</p>
<p class="body">You you think that the reason why he was targeted because he was directly costing the hospital money because people weren't going in? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm not saying I, I'm saying that the observation is that early treatment keeps people out of the hospital and that hospitals have financial incentives</p>

<p class="body">I mean for COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Including death incentives. Financial incentives</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">To discourage early treatment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And the other data point is these that are doing the attacking</p>
<p class="body">Are almost universally, hospital administrators and hospitalists</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So they're these aren't physicians these</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Aren't by hospitals I mean hospital based physicians? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, what does that mean then? </p>
<p class="body">What why are they doing? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It 'cause they're part of that system of that hospital system</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it the administrators, they would be doing that because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">They're making they're making, so again, I don't want to make accusations</p>
<p class="body">I'm observing facts, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I want to bring this back to something we were talking about earlier, but we kind of moved past it</p>
<p class="body">We were talking about the one in</p>
1000 statistic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, so a recent paper out of Hong Kong comprehensive analysis cardiac myocarditis in boys hospitalized</p>
<p class="body">OK, that makes sense</p>
<p class="body">That's that's word string</p>
<p class="body">So that's the data analysis</p>
<p class="body">So that's that's saying the myocarditis was so bad after vaccination and these are all verified post vaccination</p>
<p class="body">The myocarditis was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incidence rate is 1 in 2700</p>
<p class="body">Now there's all kinds of hand waving</p>
<p class="body">That, Oh my carditis is mild and they recover from it, OK? </p>
<p class="body">Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact</p>
<p class="body">Historic incidence of death post myocarditis is about 27%</p>
<p class="body">Now the assertion is, well, this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids</p>
<p class="body">Or young adults? </p>
<p class="body">OK, but that's being said in the absence of data, it's pure speculation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right and why are they doing that? </p>
<p class="body">Because they keep saying that the the instances of myocarditis are mild</p>
<p class="body">I keep hearing that that it's mild myocarditis and that it eventually goes away, but not citing any studies</p>
<p class="body">And I don't think there are any long term studies of children that have been vaccinated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, there can't be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That can't be</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">By definition, right right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">By definition</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Because because we haven't done what we have always done</p>
<p class="body">OK, so let me say this, people ask me, Robert, you're the inventor of this tech</p>
<p class="body">Urovac cynologist</p>
<p class="body">Why are you speaking out? </p>
<p class="body">This was the whole topic of the Atlantic Monthly or attack article</p>
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">Why is? </p>
<p class="body">This person become a vaccine skeptic the the the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did they talk to you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Extensively in the three days before this thing came out, the journalist who's it's a fascinating a young man he previously publishes basically unwoke issues in the Chronicle of Higher Education</p>
<p class="body">This is his first big article</p>
<p class="body">OK, he was clearly hired and they explicitly say the article was funded</p>
<p class="body">By the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Zuckerberg Chan Nishat if</p>
<p class="body">OK, Robert Wood Johnson is made the major shareholder in J&J and Zuckerberg. Chan of course, is Facebook</p>
<p class="body">OK, so Facebook and Ekeberg Chen had funded this attack article by this guy that normally writes about wokeness in the Journal of Higher Education</p>
<p class="body">And he was totally obsessed over this question, Robert, why are you saying these things? </p>
<p class="body">You must have some financial incentive</p>
<p class="body">There must be some reason why you're doing this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did you meet with? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And I</p>
<p class="body">This man in person, no</p>
<p class="body">Just over the phone OK, and I told him repeatedly because it's the right thing to do</p>
<p class="body">I get this, you know this consternation</p>
<p class="body">But see The thing is, I think I'm maybe the only one that has been involved deeply in the development of this tech</p>
<p class="body">That doesn't have a financial stake in it, right? </p>
<p class="body">So for me, the reason is because what's happening is not right, it's destroying my profession</p>
<p class="body">It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide</p>
<p class="body">It's destroying public health and medicine</p>
<p class="body">I am a vaccine ologist</p>
<p class="body">I've spent 30 years developing vaccine, a stupid amount of education</p>
<p class="body">Learning how to do it and what the rules are and for me I'm personally offended</p>
<p class="body">By watching my discipline</p>
<p class="body">Get destroyed</p>
<p class="body">For no good reason at all, except apparently financial incentives and and I don't know political ask covering</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now back to this number, because we keep going past it and going off on tangents</p>
<p class="body">You know the the number that keeps getting cited is 1 in 1000 people have adverse events and including myocarditis</p>
<p class="body">If myocarditis that requires hospitalization is 1 in 2700</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">In boys</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In boys, but there's also issues of people that have</p>
<p class="body">Something like fatigue that has lasted post vaccination, but I mean there's a lot of those</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Those are the</p>
<p class="body">Those are the little ones</p>
<p class="body">Like there's a huge number of dysmenorrhea and manometry Raja</p>
<p class="body">What are those? </p>
<p class="body">This is alterations in menses in women</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So there is</p>
<p class="body">There's a huge issue, there's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And and they deny it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Menses menstrual cycles</p>
<p class="body">Some women go into menopause very young, like I know, a girl who's 36 who got the vaccine hasn't had her</p>
<p class="body">Period in eight months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And then there is the women who are postmenopausal, that suddenly start bleeding</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so here's the thing about this, Joe</p>
<p class="body">That kind of ties this together</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm I'm in the business</p>
<p class="body">It's basically the part of what I do is like a detective</p>
<p class="body">Figuring out 'cause I'm trained in pathology</p>
<p class="body">Why is this happening? </p>
<p class="body">What are the things that connect these things? </p>
<p class="body">OK, So what is it that drives menstruation? </p>
<p class="body">The answer is the ovary</p>
<p class="body">The ovary is the controller</p>
<p class="body">OK, through hormones</p>
<p class="body">OK, what did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package, which by the way, when that was disclosed by Byron Bridal from Japan and sent to me was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten</p>
<p class="body">OK, and when I got that I picked out as Byron had done</p>
<p class="body">I was given the task of independently evaluating it and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respect and I said these are the things I see</p>
<p class="body">This looks really bad</p>
<p class="body">He looked at it and he said, oh, you missed this thing that the other thing</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">These these missing things include reproductive toxicology</p>
<p class="body">Evaluations of teratogenicity. Birth defects</p>
<p class="body">Standard stuff that's always done, genotoxicity not done</p>
<p class="body">What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">And used other miRNAs</p>
<p class="body">In non GLP that's fancy talk for not done with rigour</p>
<p class="body">Studies not done according to the rules</p>
<p class="body">All cobbled together and sent into the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going ahead and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization</p>
<p class="body">That's the truth of it</p>
<p class="body">That's the short version that's, you know, using common language</p>
<p class="body">One of the studies they did do was administer these lipid RNA complexes</p>
2 rodents</p>
<p class="body">And showed the distribution of the synthetic lipid component</p>
<p class="body">That's the fats that package the RNA that let it slip into your cells</p>
<p class="body">It's a it's a synthetic chemical</p>
<p class="body">Positively charged molecule</p>
<p class="body">It's a fat with a charge on the end</p>
<p class="body">It goes to the ovary</p>
<p class="body">At a very high rate, like 11%</p>
<p class="body">Of the lipids now, this wasn't supposed to happen</p>
<p class="body">It was supposed to stay in the arm where it got jabbed, but it doesn't</p>
<p class="body">It goes all over the body</p>
<p class="body">And when it goes to two places that are really kind of anomalous bone marrow and ovaries, now the ovarian signal is really clear because it doesn't happen in testes</p>
<p class="body">Now, so now you've got a molecule synthetic molecule</p>
<p class="body">Going to an organ</p>
<p class="body">The ovary</p>
<p class="body">That controls menstruation</p>
<p class="body">In a nonclinical model at rodent</p>
<p class="body">And subsequently it's deployed widely in humans and you have this phenomena</p>
<p class="body">Of alteration in menstrual cycle</p>
<p class="body">Now, one of the things that was fascinating</p>
<p class="body">I was asked to testify to the Hasidic Jew rabbinical court in New York</p>
<p class="body">A lot of interesting things happen with that</p>
<p class="body">It's like sitting around with 15 different candles</p>
<p class="body">It's one of those bucket list things I guess</p>
<p class="body">I'm talking to him</p>
<p class="body">It turns out that the rabbis in the Hasidic Jew community carefully monitor</p>
<p class="body">We don't need to go into how the menstrual cycle of the fertile women in their congregations</p>
<p class="body">Closely monitor it because there is strict guidance about cleanliness and intercourse</p>
<p class="body">And they had a major problem</p>
<p class="body">Because they these these, you know these are all 60 plus up to 80 longbeards right here that had exquisite understanding about the menstrual cycle</p>
<p class="body">In all the women in their congregations</p>
<p class="body">And they all knew that these menstrual cycles were being disrupted all the time</p>
<p class="body">And for them, this was a major crisis, because it meant that if you're if you're in the Hasidic community</p>
<p class="body">Increasing the size of the population of acidic Jews is kind of important to you</p>
<p class="body">It's centrally important to them, and this was a major threat to reproductive health in their communities</p>
<p class="body">Now they they took all this testimony</p>
<p class="body">They thought about it and they came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated</p>
<p class="body">This has the power of law in this Community should not be vaccinated in adults</p>
<p class="body">It's strongly discouraged and part of the reason is because of these alterations in reproduction</p>
<p class="body">And again, the point</p>
<p class="body">And again, the point</p>
<p class="body">What's the common variable is the ovary</p>
<p class="body">This is why I say in my little statement that's gone all over the world</p>
<p class="body">This is why I say in my little statement that's gone all over the world</p>
<p class="body">This little 4 minute clip</p>
<p class="body">That's kind of gone viral and triggered governments to attack me now like Israel in Spain and Italy</p>
<p class="body">In in the same systematic pattern of you know</p>
<p class="body">On trying to demean me and delegitimize me</p>
<p class="body">That's why I say in that that</p>
<p class="body">That think twice about giving these jabs to your kids</p>
<p class="body">Among other things, your your girls are born with all the eggs they will ever have</p>
<p class="body">And these lipids are going to the ovaries, and they appear to be affecting</p>
<p class="body">Menstruation in some way</p>
<p class="body">But menstruation is just one of these adverse events</p>
<p class="body">You picked out some of the other ones</p>
<p class="body">The fatigue brain fog, all kinds of things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, to be fair, people get that from COVID as</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well true, absolutely true, and that's another fascinating variable is we have COVID</p>
<p class="body">We have M RNA genetic vaccines and we have DNA virus administered genetic vaccines. That's the J&J here in the United States and no virus, OK? </p>
<p class="body">And they all have these symptoms of clotting, brain fog and other things OK</p>
<p class="body">And so, as you know, this is basically does it walk like a duck, and quacks like a duck? </p>
<p class="body">What is the common variable between those three very different systems? </p>
<p class="body">Natural viral infection, M RNA, genetic vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">And DNA genetic vaccines</p>
<p class="body">Now we don't see these problems, by the way</p>
<p class="body">Adenoviral vectored vaccines have been in development for</p>
<p class="body">My entire life 30 years</p>
<p class="body">Their licensed adenoviral vector vaccines</p>
<p class="body">They don't have these problems</p>
<p class="body">OK, so it's something that's not intrinsic to the platform</p>
<p class="body">What is it? </p>
<p class="body">The common variable is spike? </p>
<p class="body">Just to cut to the chase protein, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And so the spike protein is probably causing all these problems with people who have caught COVID and also</p>
<p class="body">People who are getting the vaccine, but then the Lipo</p>
<p class="body">What is it? </p>
<p class="body">Lipo nanoparticle particles</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's fine, that's</p>
<p class="body">A good term how? </p>
<p class="body">Do you say Idlib? I call them lip. Lexus lipid nanoparticles is another term</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Living there nanoparticles</p>
<p class="body">So so these are the ones that are affecting the ovaries</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's the</p>
<p class="body">It's the lipid part of it in particular that goes to the ovaries, not the RNA</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And that that aspect of it is not affecting men, but with many of a higher incidence of myocarditis? </p>
<p class="body">And why is that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Good question</p>
<p class="body">What is driving the myocarditis so there's a couple there? </p>
<p class="body">A variety of hypothesis about this</p>
<p class="body">What we do know is that both the virus and these vaccines are associated with</p>
<p class="body">Here's another fancy medical term micro coagulation or micro Coagulopathy</p>
<p class="body">The latter 1 being a disease of micro coagulation, small blood clots OK</p>
<p class="body">The latter 1 being a disease of micro coagulation, small blood clots OK</p>
<p class="body">There are multiple ways in which that can happen</p>
<p class="body">It's clear that Spike is associated with a variety of of mechanisms that caught the trigger coagulation, including an autoimmune 1</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there's something about this</p>
<p class="body">This protein spike</p>
<p class="body">Is whether it's in the vaccine or not</p>
<p class="body">It binds to the surface of key cells through a key regulatory protein called ACE</p>
<p class="body">Two ace two is involved in controlling blood pressure vessel blood vessel tone, all kinds of stuff</p>
<p class="body">If you activate ACE 2 on the little</p>
<p class="body">Tiny smooth muscle cells that wrap around your capillary's</p>
<p class="body">That control your vascular tone? </p>
<p class="body">That's that's your blood pressure locally</p>
<p class="body">OK, the ability of blood to go through those tubes</p>
<p class="body">OK, that's controlled</p>
<p class="body">Basically, you've got these little muscles</p>
<p class="body">Souls cellular muscles</p>
<p class="body">That control the contraction</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of like peristalsis</p>
<p class="body">If you know what that is, the the kind of process that can move something down a tube, like in our gut</p>
<p class="body">You know the way we move food and waste material through our gut</p>
<p class="body">And eventually excrete it</p>
<p class="body">That's peristalsis</p>
<p class="body">The thing that brings it down through our esophagus</p>
<p class="body">Same thing happens with your blood vessels, and when ACE 2 fires off, it gets activated</p>
<p class="body">It causes contraction of parasites and blocks</p>
<p class="body">These micro vessels and if you get stagnant blood in blood vessels</p>
<p class="body">It clots like that</p>
<p class="body">That's what it does</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">It's a normal homeostatic mechanisms, so there's that</p>
<p class="body">There's the whole cast, so there's there's the effects on the local tissue, and there is direct effects triggering coagulation through a number of pathways</p>
<p class="body">Now what can cause myocarditis pericarditis, a number of things, autoimmune processes which we also know are involved in some of the coagulation problems? </p>
<p class="body">And this kind of process of clamping down on blood vessels</p>
<p class="body">Which we know is happening</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In the autoimmune response, is this also in response to spike protein? </p>
<p class="body">Like what is what is causing the auto immune response? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's observed that it is happening and it's happening with these</p>
<p class="body">RNA vaccines, it's happening with the adenoviral vectored vaccines</p>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">I don't recall literature that it's happening with the virus itself, but it may very well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Be I know quite a few people that have had viral outbreaks post like things like shingles</p>
<p class="body">Herpes outbreaks 
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, now that's another one</p>
<p class="body">OK, so now you're opening the pot</p>
<p class="body">The compartment before we were talking about cardiac and blood vessels</p>
<p class="body">Yes, and we talked a little bit about the brain</p>
<p class="body">We didn't talk about the strokes</p>
<p class="body">We talked about the brain fog and it's known that spike will open the the blood brain barrier is this</p>
<p class="body">Kind of concept</p>
<p class="body">It's a little loose, but it has to do with the structure of the cells that line the blood vessels in your brain and what it allows to go through and doesn't go through</p>
<p class="body">Spike causes that to become more like an open sieve so things can go into your brain</p>
<p class="body">That shouldn't go into your brain, so that can trigger brain inflammation and that</p>
<p class="body">Is one of the that is the risk that people like Luc Montagnier are concerned about with neurofibrillary tangles, which and that's why they talk about prions or Alzheimer's like symptoms</p>
<p class="body">That's part of what happens when brain gets inflammation because it's got stuff going on in there that's not supposed to have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So hence the brain fog</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The brain fog could be due to microvascular blockade</p>
<p class="body">It could be due to this clamping of blood vessels that I was talking about</p>
<p class="body">It could be due to leaky blood vessels</p>
<p class="body">That's the blood brain barrier breaching hard to say multifactorial</p>
<p class="body">All we know is</p>
<p class="body">That is happening</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's also something that's happening to people with COVID as</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, correct, I've experienced it myself</p>
<p class="body">OK, when I had when I wasn't sick and not only brain fog</p>
<p class="body">You can remember the broadcaster cummo when he had COVID he was talking about seeing hallucinations</p>
<p class="body">That is, that is a common consequence of primary COVID infection is not just brain fog, but overt hallucinations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now after the vaccines started to be administered, it was a couple months later</p>
<p class="body">I believe that the Salk Institute published their paper on spike proteins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, and I cited that in the Brett Dark Brett Weinstein Dark Horse Podcast and was immediately attacked by Reuters</p>
<p class="body">For spreading disinformation, because I was speaking that the spike protein was a toxin and there's actually that's one of many papers that have come out since then</p>
<p class="body">Or before</p>
<p class="body">And I didn't say the spike protein on the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">I said the spike protein and Reuters basically took my words, twisted them and then</p>
<p class="body">Attacked me about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It is the spike protein in the vaccine different than the spike protein in the virus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The answer is yes in a way that matters is the question</p>
<p class="body">So the difference is now we're going to get into molecular virology</p>
<p class="body">I'm sorry, but you asked the question</p>
<p class="body">So Spike kind of you can think of it as having a stem part and a head group</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Point your tie if you like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Uh, yeah, right</p>
<p class="body">There's these things sticking out here but but I wanted to illustrate that it also has this little</p>
<p class="body">It's like catcher's glove that sits on top</p>
<p class="body">That is the receptor binding domain</p>
<p class="body">OK, so it's got these these elements that are really important to understand it</p>
<p class="body">And this</p>
<p class="body">This part of the spike protein that is kind of straight and thin</p>
<p class="body">The stalk</p>
<p class="body">Is responsible for the business part of what Spike does spike causes fusion between the virus and the cell</p>
<p class="body">It's what enables the virus to infect the cell</p>
<p class="body">And it's a complex set of events and it changes its structure as it goes through those</p>
<p class="body">It's fascinating stuff if you're into those, OK</p>
<p class="body">You can lock it into the pre fusion confirmation</p>
<p class="body">You can make it so that it will not trigger cell fusion after binding with two little tiny mutations substituting proline</p>
<p class="body">In the S2 domain</p>
<p class="body">And that'll make it so that it can never trigger fusion, which is one of the things that it can do to bake toxicity that has nothing to do with whether or not it combined ACE two up here</p>
<p class="body">Whether or not that catchers Mitt will grab on days too, by the way, spike exists as a trimmer, like a trouble folk, you know, on a on a fishing lure</p>
<p class="body">So these two mutations are in this S2 domain. That's kind of the stem</p>
<p class="body">And it makes it so that it can't fuse</p>
<p class="body">And that's what's in the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">But the rest of the spike is the natural spike</p>
<p class="body">And yes, it does get cut off and it does go in the circulation</p>
<p class="body">That's all been proven, and So what matters about that is all the things I've been talking about about Spike interacting with ACE two and turning on ACE 2</p>
<p class="body">That can all still happen under that's changed</p>
<p class="body">One of the attacks that's made against my staying</p>
<p class="body">This is Oh no</p>
<p class="body">They engineered spike so that it's non toxic</p>
<p class="body">OK that fails two tests</p>
<p class="body">Number one at the time they did this engineering I've I've carefully reviewed the papers</p>
<p class="body">OK, it's all about making it more immunogenic</p>
<p class="body">There is nothing in there about making it less toxic</p>
<p class="body">OK, and</p>
<p class="body">By definition, it will make it less toxic as a fusion fusion protein, but it won't do anything about it</p>
<p class="body">The other parts of of spike and its activities</p>
<p class="body">Then then there is this fundamental logic flaw</p>
<p class="body">In in clinical development and non clinical development and safety and pharmacology</p>
<p class="body">I like to say the French judicial system applies</p>
<p class="body">What that is, is you're guilty until proven innocent</p>
<p class="body">It's the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their engineered spike is safe</p>
<p class="body">They never did that</p>
<p class="body">And so all of this</p>
<p class="body">Pressure that comes back</p>
<p class="body">You know from folks like me saying, hey, this isn't right</p>
<p class="body">OK, and it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck</p>
<p class="body">It's probably toxic because it's the common variable I get criticized because Oh well, you know</p>
<p class="body">Well, prove that it's not safe</p>
<p class="body">I'm sorry that's not the way it works</p>
<p class="body">It's farmers job to prove that it is safe, not my job</p>
<p class="body">To prove that it's not safe</p>
<p class="body">I'm observing this safety signal</p>
<p class="body">The safety signal is there, it is associated with</p>
<p class="body">Vectors that express spike, whether it's the vaccine, the virus or the adeno virus</p>
<p class="body">You know the M RNA, the virus, the virus itself, or the adenoviral vectored spike</p>
<p class="body">Those toxicities are there</p>
<p class="body">And the common variable is the spike protein, so you know and then then the comp comment</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's not a toxin like I'm kind of in the Forrest Gump School of Toxicity</p>
<p class="body">You know if it causes toxicity, it is right</p>
<p class="body">It is a toxin, by definition it is, you know</p>
<p class="body">The toxin is as a toxin does</p>
<p class="body">You know we can argue about the meaning of toxin just like so much of the rest of our language has been perverted during this, but a simple explanation</p>
<p class="body">You know, the simple definition is, does it cause toxicity in people? </p>
<p class="body">I think the answer is pretty clear now</p>
<p class="body">It does the question</p>
<p class="body">They were all arguing about is how often and how</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Bad. This is the question</p>
<p class="body">So why do so many people take the vaccine and have no adverse effect at all? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Great question, and that is a normal situation in any drug</p>
<p class="body">We talked about Bell curves</p>
<p class="body">There's a response curve</p>
<p class="body">Humans are genetically complex and their phenotypic complex</p>
<p class="body">I am not a judicial judicial, judicial, judicial</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Choo Choo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Champion right? </p>
<p class="body">I am not the same body mass index as I was when I was 25</p>
<p class="body">It seems that</p>
<p class="body">The common factor across many people that get both the vaccine adverse events and the disease, and by the way, is a great paper out</p>
<p class="body">That tried to dissect long COVID</p>
<p class="body">And differentiate it from post vaccination syndrome, which is what we're talking about</p>
<p class="body">And they did statistical analysis</p>
<p class="body">Large cohort of patients</p>
<p class="body">Basically they're indistinguishable</p>
<p class="body">Long COVID and post vaccination syndrome in terms of the spectrum of the syndrome, their incidence kind of stuff</p>
<p class="body">They're indistinguishable</p>
<p class="body">Do the same thing</p>
<p class="body">So why one of the factors that seems to be common? </p>
<p class="body">Is this kind of hyper glycemic index? </p>
<p class="body">People that are not necessarily diabetic, but they may be prediabetic or they have problems with carbohydrate metabolism or their eating</p>
<p class="body">Too many sugars or whatever The thing is so they've got elevated hemoglobin, H1C etc. People that have high glycemic index indices seem to be particularly susceptible to these effects</p>
<p class="body">Now that is a syndrome associated with an inflammatory state in blood vessels</p>
<p class="body">You know this</p>
<p class="body">What you're asking again and again because you are who you are, is in plain language</p>
<p class="body">The big you know picture issues that are sitting out there that haven't been adequately addressed now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not only haven't been adequately addressed, but when you do address them, you get demonized, even if you're just asking questions</p>
<p class="body">As far as like what are the numbers, what is the data? </p>
<p class="body">Where can I see this data? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">If you're an academic, you get run out</p>
<p class="body">Yeah no, no</p>
<p class="body">We've talked I I don't want to avoid</p>
<p class="body">You talked about some of the other adverse events and you started talking about</p>
<p class="body">The ones that relate to immune response, yes, and that is the the tip of the iceberg that most people are familiar with is the common CDC never talks about it, but it's clearly there in the literature</p>
<p class="body">You know, in places even New England Journal of Medicine</p>
<p class="body">It's clearly there in the various database</p>
<p class="body">Is latent virus reactivation and the most obvious one is shingles</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if you get shingles, I've had shingles</p>
<p class="body">It hurts that you you don't</p>
<p class="body">You don't miss it</p>
<p class="body">When you get it</p>
<p class="body">Epstein Barr virus, other herpes viruses, cytomegalovirus</p>
<p class="body">What are these all in common? </p>
<p class="body">Their DNA latent DNA, viruses OK so So what? </p>
<p class="body">Latent DNA viruses</p>
<p class="body">Well, we have a bunch of DNA viruses that basically hide inside our body</p>
<p class="body">And they are kept suppressed</p>
<p class="body">Matter of fact, there's a whole thread in vaccinology</p>
<p class="body">We talk about immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system</p>
<p class="body">Part of that has to do with the thymus and it's shrinking</p>
<p class="body">That's what educates T cells by the way, that's one of the reasons why children basically shrugged this disease off</p>
'cause they haven't had that fimic in evolution, but one of the things that happens is your T cells become increasingly focused on suppressing the DNA viruses that we've all been parasitized by</p>
<p class="body">Like cytomegalovirus and so you can watch over time the the diversity of T cells in persons body who's infected by CMV over time as they get older and older their T cells get more and more and more focused on just trying to keep CMV in the box and not let it out</p>
<p class="body">OK, so when we see DNA viruses you know Pandora's box is opening and they're jumping out of there</p>
<p class="body">OK, well the thing that's keeps Pandora's box closed is T cell responses</p>
<p class="body">And then we have, you know, I hope someday you get a</p>
<p class="body">Chance to have Ryan Cole on</p>
<p class="body">Pathologist deep understanding of this</p>
<p class="body">As he points out, he's seeing</p>
<p class="body">Referrals from oncologists</p>
<p class="body">Of cancers that are unusual</p>
<p class="body">They're occurring early</p>
<p class="body">They're behaving irregularly</p>
<p class="body">They're behaving very aggressively now</p>
<p class="body">Right now this is still anecdotal</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to get the audience all wound up, all going to die of cancer</p>
<p class="body">Doctor Malone is not saying we're all going to die of cancer, OK, but</p>
<p class="body">This is another of those little OHS</p>
<p class="body">Because the thing that keeps cancer suppressed is T cells</p>
<p class="body">Then we have the laboratory data that we're seeing abnormalities in the key signaling molecules that that T cells used to talk to each other to like receptors</p>
<p class="body">That are associated in particular with the M RNA vaccines</p>
<p class="body">So something is happening</p>
<p class="body">OK that is causing release of T cell suppression</p>
<p class="body">Reactivation of latent DNA viruses, maybe some signals relating to oncology</p>
<p class="body">Some changes in T cell signaling behavior</p>
<p class="body">And then there's this, this increasing awareness that there's some window of time</p>
<p class="body">Not sure how long after vaccination when you're actually more susceptible to infection</p>
<p class="body">And this may have something to do</p>
<p class="body">So not only is the vaccine efficacy waning</p>
<p class="body">But the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T cell suppression</p>
<p class="body">So there's a whole lot in this box of immunology, and what are the jabs doing to our immune system and how long does it last? </p>
<p class="body">That is, let's say, gently, a little worrisome to some of us that have a background</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In these things, this T cell suppression are</p>
<p class="body">Are there any studies on the amount of time? </p>
<p class="body">That it takes before your your system rebalances itself post jab, and seeing is it accumulative? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you're dealing with three shots or four shots? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's this is this is the I'm sorry this is the obscenity</p>
<p class="body">For me of this whole well, we're going to give four shots because we don't really know when we know we need to do something</p>
<p class="body">I like to talk about the metaphor as a father</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if you've had kids, I'm a grandfather</p>
<p class="body">OK, you give a 3 year old a hammer and everything becomes</p>
<p class="body">A nail</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, OK, that's that's kind of a simple way of saying</p>
<p class="body">People that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it</p>
<p class="body">In this case, there's multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs</p>
<p class="body">The simplest one for everybody to understand is when your son develops seasonal allergies to ragweed pollen or whatever</p>
<p class="body">And it's so bad that he can't go to school</p>
<p class="body">His eyes are running</p>
<p class="body">He can't play in sports whatever you're like, oh we gotta do something about this I'm gonna take him to rheumatologist allergist</p>
<p class="body">And see what they can do</p>
<p class="body">They do a bunch of tests and they say, oh, your son is allergic to ragweed pollen or whatever</p>
<p class="body">The thing is, OK, what do they do? </p>
<p class="body">Well they give him</p>
<p class="body">What are those shots? </p>
<p class="body">They're high doses of antigen</p>
<p class="body">That are administered repeatedly to your child</p>
<p class="body">And what it does is induces something that is immunologist</p>
<p class="body">We call high zone tolerance</p>
<p class="body">Hi, zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen to shut down T cells</p>
<p class="body">Against in an antigen specific fashion</p>
<p class="body">So there's that</p>
<p class="body">The other thing with the multiple jabs is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched</p>
<p class="body">OK, they don't fit the current, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I pause you for a second before you continue? </p>
<p class="body">So you're saying that by if, like if someone is allergic to things and they go to an allergist and they start getting shots, those shots shut down T cell response, correct? </p>
<p class="body">So those shots by doing so and shutting down T cell response</p>
<p class="body">The idea is that it kicks your immune system in and it's supposed to fight off these things</p>
<p class="body">Does it make you more vulnerable to other diseases? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">They because they're using that antigen, OK, the ragweed pollen? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's causing deletion or downregulation of the team memory population responsible for responding to ragweed pollen</p>
<p class="body">So what it's doing is selectively shutting down</p>
<p class="body">The T response against that antigen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And but what about everything else? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, generally not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It won't affect it, no? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I won't say it won't affect it, but it the effect on the overall immune response is negligible in that this is done clinically routinely</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there's there's those two things</p>
<p class="body">There's this short term issue we don't know how long it lasts</p>
<p class="body">There's the</p>
<p class="body">The high zone tolerance issue</p>
<p class="body">And then there is with their multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus</p>
<p class="body">That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping it's gonna protect against this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Flu, well, that's one of the most confusing things about this push for people to get boosted now</p>
<p class="body">With Omicron 'cause they keep saying with Omicron, we need to get, but that's a vaccine escape variant, isn't it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, among other things, so that if when you want to open that can of Omicron</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I want to say what we know so far is at least Peter McCullough said this and I believe several other people have said this as well, that the immunity that you may have had to the alpha variant or the delta variant</p>
<p class="body">It does not seem to work very well against Omicron</p>
<p class="body">That's true</p>
<p class="body">Nor does the immunity imparted by vaccines</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">By the way, since we're we're down, this little rabbit hole</p>
<p class="body">Let me just say one thing Peter called me and he said Robert make sure you talk to Joe</p>
<p class="body">And make it clear that although I spoke clearly and forcefully</p>
<p class="body">About one and done when I was on his show that was before Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and so Peter wanted me to make sure that your audience</p>
<p class="body">Knew no yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yes, we we've actually talked about that because I have several friends right now that have tested positive for COVID for a second time and that is post that podcast with him</p>
<p class="body">He was pretty sure that if you got delta you would never get it again, but I know people that have had not I</p>
<p class="body">Honestly I don't know anybody who had delta, which was the last</p>
<p class="body">Phase I know people who had the original version of COVID who have now gotten Omicron</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">In my case, I had the original Wuhan strain and I got infected with Delta and I had disease for about 3 days and that's after taking to the two jabs wow</p>
<p class="body">So so yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then how far after taking the two jobs, was it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">About four months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Four months, yeah, four months</p>
<p class="body">So that's still inside the window of efficacy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's another thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You say you're infected by COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, like nine months like yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Early on February, nine months, OK, but you still had a horrible reaction</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">To it totally</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then even that</p>
<p class="body">This is pure speculation</p>
<p class="body">The waning efficacy of the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Does that have an effect on your natural immunity? </p>
<p class="body">The natural immunity that you've had? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So you're now opening up the big big</p>
<p class="body">Can a whip pass? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that a D? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
80 So that's a whole another rabbit hole, and I like to call it vaccine enhanced infection or disease because 80 is just one subset</p>
<p class="body">Of that 
<p class="body">OK, but there is signs in some data</p>
<p class="body">And we were</p>
<p class="body">We were talking about this just before the broadcast</p>
<p class="body">From Denmark, among other places</p>
<p class="body">Of negative efficacy</p>
<p class="body">Against omicron 
<p class="body">As a function of the number of vaccinations up to three</p>
<p class="body">Negative efficacy, positive efficacy means it protects you</p>
<p class="body">Negative efficacy means your probability of being infected is higher</p>
<p class="body">If you've taken the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">And it's compared to unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">It seems to be somewhat higher</p>
<p class="body">If you've had one jab, even worse, even more likely to get infected if you've had two jabs even more infect likely to get infected</p>
<p class="body">If you had three jobs now, don't jump straight</p>
<p class="body">To 80 E</p>
<p class="body">Because the problem</p>
<p class="body">Just to illustrate this confounding variable problem, which is what all the statisticians argue about endlessly</p>
<p class="body">Is that? </p>
<p class="body">There's all kinds of things that can complicate this interpretation</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to give you the simple one</p>
<p class="body">If somebody feels that they're fully Vaxxed and they're living, you know their young person in Denmark or whatever in Europe, they're more likely to go engage in risky behaviors</p>
<p class="body">Such as maybe they go out clubbing</p>
<p class="body">Whereas before they may have said no, I'm not going to go out clubbing you crazy</p>
<p class="body">Now they feel like they're Superman</p>
<p class="body">They've got</p>
<p class="body">A shield right? </p>
<p class="body">And so they engage in more risky behaviors, and so there's an example of a confounding variable, one of many</p>
<p class="body">So that's the that's the I want to caution that I'm not saying that this shows that we're having vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Enhanced infection, I'm saying that this is a risk which the FDA knew about</p>
<p class="body">Explicitly identified told the vaccine manufacturers they should set up studies to detect whether or not it's happening</p>
<p class="body">But didn't force them to do it</p>
<p class="body">This is another one of the huge FDA fails here</p>
<p class="body">They had the right and responsibility to ensure that we had good data about this and they took a pass</p>
<p class="body">They said vaccine manufacturer</p>
<p class="body">We think you should do this, but you know it's optional and so they never did it</p>
<p class="body">No surprise</p>
<p class="body">It's like first rule of clinical development</p>
<p class="body">When you're in Big Pharma, you never ask a question that you don't want to know the answer to</p>
<p class="body">Unless you're absolutely forced to do it</p>
<p class="body">That's why the FDA is supposed to do its job, but in this case with enhanced disease, a known risk of all prior coronavirus vaccine development efforts, including veterinary</p>
<p class="body">Chronic complication with those efforts</p>
<p class="body">The reason why I focused on drug repurposing? </p>
<p class="body">We're going to need drugs</p>
<p class="body">Best way we can get drugs is drug repurposing, yay</p>
<p class="body">And then I got my team to focus on that</p>
<p class="body">That's why we did that</p>
<p class="body">FDA is known that this is a risk</p>
<p class="body">Although vaccine ologists notes a risk, it's in the literature</p>
<p class="body">We've all been kind of watching carefully, so I have is this risk and a manifest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I pause you for a? </p>
<p class="body">Second, when you're saying statistically</p>
<p class="body">It seems that one jab makes you more likely to get Omicron than unvaccinated 2 jabs, even more so</p>
<p class="body">Three jobs more so</p>
<p class="body">Where is this date? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's coming</p>
<p class="body">It's a series of analysis</p>
<p class="body">There's a really active group of biostatisticians worldwide in right now that are picking apart the primary data that's coming out</p>
<p class="body">There was a paper that was published from the Netherlands, as I recall</p>
<p class="body">That had or or it was a publication from official publication by the government</p>
<p class="body">That had the primary data and then this primary data has been analyzed re analyzed</p>
<p class="body">Discuss on sub stack blah blah blah torn apart and rebuild</p>
<p class="body">Now we put out a sub stack statement that summarizes some of this that you can easily find from us, but it's an ongoing debate, but the</p>
<p class="body">The effect size is now now what the statisticians are arguing about is well, whether or not they had the right number for the denominator of total cases</p>
<p class="body">This gets back to my point that the databases are all contaminated because the incidence of the virus in the population</p>
<p class="body">Is a function of testing</p>
<p class="body">In other words, you don't look for it</p>
<p class="body">You don't see it, then you assume you're not having it right</p>
<p class="body">And in the Netherlands they have one of the best testing systems, so they have rigorously testing everybody for whether or not they get in the virus, and so those numbers are a little</p>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<p class="body">Sketchy, and that's what everybody is arguing about is is should we be looking at only the 12 and above cohort? </p>
<p class="body">You know it's all this is, but the effect size is so large</p>
<p class="body">That it's we can</p>
<p class="body">We can argue about these confounding variables until the cows come home, but it's a big effect</p>
<p class="body">It's going to be hard to account for otherwise</p>
<p class="body">It is not in peer reviewed publications</p>
<p class="body">This kind of stuff is wicked hard to publish these days and it takes months</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of COVID? </p>
<p class="body">Because this particular strain of COVID this omicron? </p>
<p class="body">Is a vaccine escape variant, meaning that it's sort of tried to find its way around the protection of the vaccine so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Now you're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's selected for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That so now you're trying to impose a high</p>
<p class="body">What you're doing is generating hypothesis, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Which is good</p>
<p class="body">And one of many possible hypotheses, and so in a world a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things and do these kinds of studies and examine these kinds of variables without being right in social media, we would have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others</p>
<p class="body">No, that's my my way of not answering your question</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I understand well</p>
<p class="body">Is there a mechanism that would point to one of two things, whether it is a a decrease in an immune response of a person who's been vaccinated, or some opportunity? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So so let me throw out so you just hit</p>
<p class="body">Let me go down the rabbit hole of that first comment</p>
<p class="body">You made</p>
<p class="body">OK, So what we're doing is with with administering a mismatched vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Is we're driving the effector and memory cells</p>
<p class="body">B&T 
<p class="body">Towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists</p>
<p class="body">So it's not in in immune response</p>
<p class="body">You don't get everything</p>
<p class="body">End with what I think you know you didn't ask me the question, but I'm going to answer it anyhow</p>
<p class="body">What is your hypothesis for the poor durability of the vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">My answer is it looks to me like original antigenic sin</p>
<p class="body">Well, that's kind of a cool</p>
<p class="body">Terminology what that means? </p>
<p class="body">Let's unpack original antigenic sin and I think what could be happening with these data as your</p>
<p class="body">Just following your hypothesis, you just shared consistent with that</p>
<p class="body">Is that we're driving the immune response towards responding to an antigen</p>
<p class="body">The receptor binding domain, a spike that no longer exists with Omicron</p>
<p class="body">It it is, become clear it was initially denied, but it's become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold corona viruses that have significant immunologic cross reactivity with SARS, Co V2</p>
<p class="body">And the problem with that</p>
<p class="body">In original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated? </p>
<p class="body">Now let me unpack that in a way that kind of makes sense for the common person we all know</p>
<p class="body">That well in war</p>
<p class="body">The the homily is we're always best prepared for the last war</p>
<p class="body">OK, in your life you're the sum of your prior life experiences, biases, how you respond to I mean in in your martial arts you must know this</p>
<p class="body">Right, deeply what you've experienced in the past in prior fights is going to bias how you respond to a new opponent</p>
<p class="body">OK, same happens with your immune system does that</p>
<p class="body">Make sense, yes? </p>
<p class="body">OK, super OK, you now understand original antigenic sin</p>
<p class="body">OK, because the prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen, you know if you are are are having martial art</p>
<p class="body">With a person of a certain ethnic background or or physical characteristics or whatever, and they have certain strategies that they use, the next time you encounter somebody that looks like that and seems to move like that, you're going to say, oh, they're going to use the same kind of strategies your immune system acts the same way</p>
<p class="body">With viruses</p>
<p class="body">And it could be that they've they've got a whole different toolkit and you're busy fighting this war, and they come in and boom, you're dead, right? </p>
<p class="body">Same kind of thing</p>
<p class="body">OK, so we've got a new pathogen, but it's got a series of of overlaps with the old ones that we've seen before and our immune system is biased to respond</p>
<p class="body">As if it's the old one now</p>
<p class="body">To make matters worse, we're taking the spike protein</p>
<p class="body">Only one of the proteins, the dominant</p>
<p class="body">Immunologically dominant protein</p>
<p class="body">And we're japon everybody multiple times</p>
<p class="body">And driving memory cells and effector cells</p>
<p class="body">That are two a virus that is not the one we're encountering</p>
<p class="body">So it could very well be that as you're taking more jabs</p>
<p class="body">You're further skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection too</p>
<p class="body">Omicron, compared to somebody that is immunologically naive, they only have</p>
<p class="body">Presumably they've either recovered from an earlier 'cause we gotta remember the baseline group, the non vaccinated group is actually complicated because it's got those that haven't had the virus</p>
<p class="body">Before, but they've had beta coronaviruses</p>
<p class="body">And those that have had prior infection are naturally immune</p>
<p class="body">So that's you can appreciate that looking at these things kind of get squirrely</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of moving parts, but when you see a signal this strong</p>
<p class="body">It's saying something is going on</p>
<p class="body">You ought to pay attention to it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In my opinion, what is the difference between the spike protein that's generated from the injection of the vaccine versus? </p>
<p class="body">All of the variables that your body encounters when it's been infected by COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is another brilliant question</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying this to butter you up</p>
<p class="body">And thank you for asking it</p>
<p class="body">That's, uh, that was a very broad question, and this is a peel</p>
<p class="body">The onions, onion layers situation</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you said what are the differences? </p>
<p class="body">Let's start at a high level</p>
<p class="body">When you get infected where I get infected</p>
<p class="body">It's typically nasal or pharynx</p>
<p class="body">It's coming in through the mucosal membranes of your</p>
<p class="body">OK, and by the way, that's one of the other things that's kind of cool</p>
<p class="body">About omicron</p>
<p class="body">In a good way</p>
<p class="body">Is that the prior strains infect mostly deep lung and there's really fascinating data from Hong Kong suggesting that Omicron is infecting upper airway more</p>
<p class="body">That is a characteristic of less pathogenic influenza viruses</p>
<p class="body">And hopefully what we know about Omicron is, even though it's more infectious</p>
<p class="body">And replicates the higher levels</p>
<p class="body">It's less pathogenic as a paradox, well that could explain it</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there may be some good news at Nongkrong, but getting back to your question, when you take the jab</p>
<p class="body">You get a</p>
<p class="body">I don't know how to say a spike of spike</p>
<p class="body">You get a bolus, a peak fairly rapidly</p>
<p class="body">Of this viral protein</p>
<p class="body">And it's in your body</p>
<p class="body">In it circulating in your blood, we know that there's a Harvard study Brigham and Women's nurses spike protein circulation after vaccination</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I pause you? </p>
<p class="body">One one second I like when you test for kovid you go in through the nose</p>
<p class="body">If someone is getting Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Or are they less likely to test positive? </p>
<p class="body">Because you're swabbing their nose, no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">More, all of these are initially coming in here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So it still would exist in the nose even though it's affecting the back of the throat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It seems to be well, it's it's clearly producing equal or higher levels</p>
<p class="body">Delta was significantly higher in the nose</p>
<p class="body">By PCR with all of the caveats about the problems with that cycle number and Omicron seems to be even higher, significantly higher</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">OK, so hit your nose and then it goes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Down, OK, and it's affecting the throat</p>
<p class="body">For some reason</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot of the people that I know that got Omicron had a throat ache</p>
<p class="body">Throat a soreness of the throat before</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That is, paradoxically, really good news</p>
<p class="body">By the way, that's called primary data anecdotal primary data, but it beats modeling data from the CDC, which is what the New York Times has been reporting that we all have</p>
<p class="body">By this point, we're all supposed to have 70 or 80% of all the virus in the United States is supposed to be omicron, that is based on what is now known to be erroneous modeling</p>
<p class="body">And all of us that were inside when we saw this come out, we knew the group in the UK that did the modeling and we were like, oh, these guys have overpromised 
<p class="body">They have basically put out scare modeling all the way through this outbreak and we should take this with a grain of salt</p>
<p class="body">And now the press is all backpedaling and the CDC is backpedaling, saying oh</p>
<p class="body">But I think we got it wrong and there's still a lot of delta in the population</p>
<p class="body">But you know your buddies</p>
<p class="body">If it's circulating here in in Austin and you're hearing people that are having more the sore throat and runny nose and less of the my chest is burning and I've lost taste and smell</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, that's just to kind of open that up a little bit</p>
<p class="body">With H1N1 influenza just to take one example</p>
<p class="body">We have high pathogenicity and low pathogenicity versions of H1N1. What that means is some will kill you and some won't</p>
<p class="body">More or less</p>
<p class="body">The difference seems to be the virus</p>
<p class="body">The receptor, the nuances of the receptor that the virus is hitting and using to initially infect cells</p>
<p class="body">And the low pathogenicity H1N ones infect the upper airway</p>
<p class="body">And the high pathogenicity H1N ones infect the deep lung</p>
<p class="body">The prior SARS, Kobe ones have been hit in deep lung</p>
<p class="body">This report that you're giving me from your buddies</p>
<p class="body">That you think is probably Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Is consistent with the Hong Kong data</p>
<p class="body">And it all fits into a box, and we know from South Africa for sure</p>
<p class="body">That omicron in where you know the WHL made the statement</p>
<p class="body">There are no known deaths associated with Omicron in the in the world</p>
<p class="body">Now there may be a couple somewhere</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I thought it was just the United States</p>
<p class="body">I didn't know they were saying for the world because there there was a we</p>
<p class="body">We just read something that said there were several that were associated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Now there's there's as I said</p>
<p class="body">Over time there will be deaths associated</p>
<p class="body">Remember, we talked about the difference between causal and association</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, yeah? And also the fact that 95% of the people who have died from COVID had an average of four comorbidities here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK and</p>
<p class="body">You're on it, yeah so</p>
<p class="body">And and now it's been documented at least two cases when there were reported deaths</p>
<p class="body">From Omicron and people actually went back, they got picked up in the legacy media and circulated as Oh my God, it's going to kill us again</p>
<p class="body">More fear **** 
<p class="body">Then people went again like they did with the Ivy Mekton story</p>
<p class="body">Remember about the hospital, it was all full of ivory mekton toxicity and then someone bothered to call the hospital</p>
<p class="body">Same story, sorry Nope, those weren't omicron deaths</p>
<p class="body">Just something that got reported and amplified in the legacy media, so regardless the mortality of Omicron is remarkably low</p>
<p class="body">I think we can all agree on that</p>
<p class="body">That's the list of symptoms from Omicron published in Nature, I think</p>
<p class="body">Recently are pretty much 100% overlap with common cold</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And there are coronaviruses that are common colds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the beta coronaviruses that I was talking about when I was talking about</p>
<p class="body">Original antigenic sin</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So if you test positive for the common cold, do you test positive for a corona virus? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you take a COVID test? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The common cold is a is a</p>
<p class="body">In general that's not</p>
<p class="body">Tested for it</p>
<p class="body">No, it's it's a it's a grab</p>
<p class="body">Bag of stuff</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, it's rhinoviruses, it's coronaviruses</p>
<p class="body">It's influenza</p>
<p class="body">You know it's a lot of things</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of respiratory viruses that are floating around</p>
<p class="body">But getting back on on track with Omicron</p>
<p class="body">It is absolutely looking like Omicron is a mild variant</p>
<p class="body">It is absolutely</p>
<p class="body">Able to escape prior vaccination</p>
<p class="body">The control of prior vaccination</p>
<p class="body">Typically with mismatched vaccine</p>
<p class="body">It seems to be also able to infect a subset of people that are naturally immune</p>
<p class="body">Probably less than the subset that get infected with vaccination</p>
<p class="body">But in this is a kind of a key message to your audience</p>
<p class="body">The reproductive coefficient that's more fancy language</p>
<p class="body">The reproductive coefficient</p>
<p class="body">But many of your audience is going to know that that's the are not</p>
<p class="body">The R nought of the original strain will hunt</p>
<p class="body">Strain was about two to three</p>
<p class="body">That means that if I'm infected on average without any other interventions, I'll infect 2 to three other people</p>
<p class="body">OK, and for delta the R nought was more in the range of five to six if I'm infected</p>
<p class="body">No vaccination, no social distancing, no masking, blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">The average rate of transmission would be, I would infect five or six people</p>
<p class="body">In the case of Omicron</p>
<p class="body">The arnaout, the rebase reproduction coefficient is in the range of seven to 10</p>
<p class="body">OK, that is a wicked high</p>
<p class="body">That is measles</p>
<p class="body">What that means I'm going to translate that into simple language</p>
<p class="body">We are all going to get infected</p>
<p class="body">Whether you use masks or not, use social distancing or not unless you're going to go live on the Mir trail and not talk to anybody when you pass them</p>
<p class="body">You're going to get infected</p>
<p class="body">So this gets to the key point</p>
<p class="body">You know, find a doc that'll administer early treatments</p>
<p class="body">And you know what they are and you just had the expert on Peter McCullough</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's incredibly difficult to get this stuff now, that's what's incredible</p>
<p class="body">Monocle and runs</p>
<p class="body">That was the next thing I was going to ask you about</p>
<p class="body">Why would they do that? </p>
<p class="body">When well, what is the percentage of delta versus Omicron out there, and how do? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">We know, so here that's I just alluded to that a minute ago, and this is another fascinating story, and it's kind of being covered up</p>
<p class="body">It's starting to be covered by the press, but they're not going back to the cause</p>
<p class="body">OK, remember I said that there was a group in the UK</p>
<p class="body">Imperial College didn't give the specifics before, but it's a group in the UK that does modeling</p>
<p class="body">And they came out with some modeling projections that basically the entire UK hospital system was going to be inundated with</p>
<p class="body">And a lot of us looked at that and went</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, those are the same guys that have predicted that we're going to have, you know, millions and millions and millions of dead and and they're going to be body stacked up</p>
<p class="body">And, you know, coolers in the UK</p>
<p class="body">And it sure looks like they may have overshot</p>
<p class="body">Again, the CDC seems to have taken those modeling</p>
<p class="body">Projections in those models</p>
<p class="body">And they put out a member in mid December right before Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, you're all going to get infected by COVID and and it's going to sweep through and we're going to have 80% of COVID by this time of this month</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How about that ridiculous press release from the White House? </p>
<p class="body">That said, we're the winner of the unvaccinated death</p>
<p class="body">You know, experience a winner of death, and the overwhelming hospitalizations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">All I can say is that the political genius behind that should be taken out in the behind in the woodshed and given a good weapon because that was just horrible political messaging</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So horrible and in the terms in terms of Omicron, so inaccurate, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I contrasted</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but it doesn't matter, and that's that's that's the core thing</p>
<p class="body">Of of this, chronic angst of of what the heck is going on? </p>
<p class="body">This doesn't make any sense at all</p>
<p class="body">You know, I don't want to get too off your topic, but</p>
<p class="body">Our government is out of control</p>
<p class="body">On this and they are lawless</p>
<p class="body">They completely disregard bioethics</p>
<p class="body">They completely disregard the federal common rule</p>
<p class="body">They have broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years</p>
<p class="body">These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly</p>
<p class="body">Illegal, they are explicitly inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code</p>
<p class="body">They're explicitly inconsistent with the Belmont report</p>
<p class="body">They are flat out illegal and they don't care</p>
<p class="body">And the only thing standing between us</p>
<p class="body">And it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my</p>
<p class="body">You know, the unfortunate colleagues in the DoD</p>
<p class="body">Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What's wrong? </p>
<p class="body">What do you mean by the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">DoD, the mandated vaccines for all the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're mandated for everyone in the DoD</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Personnel forever, yeah</p>
<p class="body">You know what's going on in the White House is a whole another hours talk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm sure it is back to Omicron and Delta</p>
<p class="body">How do we know like what are the when you get tested? </p>
<p class="body">Like when I was tested and I came out positive for COVID</p>
<p class="body">I have no idea what I got</p>
<p class="body">I assume it was delta 'cause that's what I heard was going around, but when they release these numbers, where are they getting that data? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So in terms of this specific one, I'm sorry I got off track, so I was talking about Imperial College modeling, and the CDC seemed have picked up on</p>

<p class="body">No worries</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That yeah</p>
<p class="body">And the last data they had, it's actually Peter that sent me the data</p>
<p class="body">We did a podcast about it</p>
<p class="body">So he sent me the the modeling data</p>
<p class="body">And and he sent me the documentation that the modeling data that the CDC was putting out in the New York Times and the Presinal amplified</p>
<p class="body">You know when we all said oh we're going to have 70 or 80% omicron in the population by this time of this year? </p>
<p class="body">The only actual data they had was up to about December 4th as I recall, and it showed only a tiny fraction of omicron in the population, but then they applied their mathematical models that they apparently got from Imperial College, and they said, oh, the curve is going to look like this, and therefore that's where we're going to be at this point in time, and therefore we're going to have 70% infection</p>
<p class="body">And the press all picked it up and they just assumed that that was based on real data, not modeled data</p>
<p class="body">What I'm hearing from docs in the field again and again, and you know, I had a bunch of people call me before I came on your show</p>
<p class="body">Everybody was like Robert say this to Joe, but you know you're so important that everybody wants to get their angle in</p>
<p class="body">What I'm hearing in the field is that delta is still dominant</p>
<p class="body">And these are hospitalists and and people treating disease, and so they're seeing a skewed population</p>
<p class="body">But it's important to remember that when the CDC says those kinds of numbers, they're talking about incidents, that is, that is the moment you know how many have actually been infected at that slice of time, but</p>
<p class="body">What you see in the hospitals and this is something the press misses all the time</p>
<p class="body">So they do like you're hearing all this fear **** about how the hospitals have filled up in New York City and blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">Blah blah OK</p>
<p class="body">Omicron causes a short term limited illness</p>
<p class="body">Delta is wicked bad, and it puts you in the hospital when it puts you in the hospital</p>
<p class="body">You can be there for a month to two months</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">What you're seeing in hospitalized cases right now appears to be dominantly delta</p>
<p class="body">Because the CDC overestimated the fraction of the population that was getting they overestimated how aggressively omicron was going to move into the US population</p>
<p class="body">Maybe that means our social distancing and masking is working</p>
<p class="body">I don't know, but it's not moving in as fast as they had been projecting, and the bulk of the disease that the docs that I'm talking to are seeing in hospitals appears to be delta</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But wouldn't that be because the people that are catching delta are the ones that need to be hospitalized versus the people that are catching omicron? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Precisely OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They don't need it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">But here's the rub and you I'm looping back now to your antibody point</p>
<p class="body">Is the geniuses in our public health system said, Oh no Omicron, based on this modeling data? </p>
<p class="body">Is going to be moving into the population is going to dominate things</p>
<p class="body">We need to pull the monoclonals that are delta specific and only administer only allow people to use the monoclonals that are Omicron specific because it's going to drive further evolution otherwise</p>
<p class="body">I guess that's their logic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I haven't heard that logic at all</p>
<p class="body">I've heard that is that the monoclonal antibodies are ineffective against Omicron, but I've never seen ivol</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That's that's you're saying you're saying the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Thing I've also, but I've never seen any data that the</p>
<p class="body">Monoclonal any letters</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">There are data</p>
<p class="body">There are data that the that it's in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Where's that at? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Peer reviewed literature</p>
<p class="body">Now there's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That it's ineffective against Omicron</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I wouldn't say ineffective, less effective based on laboratory neutralization assays</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So in vitro correct OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so you know Joe lab lapidot</p>
<p class="body">Certain general</p>
<p class="body">In the state of Florida</p>
<p class="body">Has put out public statements now on I think his Twitter, among other things, saying decrying what the federal government has done of pulling all of the regular monoclonals</p>
<p class="body">What I'm hearing from frontline docs is those those you know, older, Regeneron, monoclonals, et cetera</p>
<p class="body">Are still very effective in their hospitalized population, presumably because it's still predominantly delta and yet they're no longer able to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Get it so the government has literally stopped the distribution of medicine</p>
<p class="body">True effective medicine for a disease that exists currently</p>
<p class="body">When has that ever happened before? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Uh, hydroxychloroquine and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but in this level where like hydroxychloroquine and ivory mekton were off label uses, this is something that has emergency use authorization</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">The unlabeled unlabeled yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is wild</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It is, uh, are they brain dead? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Are they trying to just encourage vaccine vaccination? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Are they trying? </p>
<p class="body">To kill</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that what all it is? </p>
<p class="body">Is this a money grab? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So here's another</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, what is that so? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Version, I mean there's that when you see this kind of</p>
<p class="body">Of public policy from logic</p>
<p class="body">Then it causes thinking people like yourself to say what the hell is going? </p>
<p class="body">On here, right? </p>
<p class="body">And then we go down the rabbit hole</p>
<p class="body">Is it this that or the other thing one of the things in that spectrum of what's going on? </p>
<p class="body">The emergencies authorizations are predicated on</p>
<p class="body">Policy determinations that were in a state of emergency</p>
<p class="body">Those are now two years old</p>
<p class="body">They're expiring</p>
<p class="body">There there is</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying this is what's going on in their head</p>
<p class="body">But there is another perverse incentive here</p>
<p class="body">To amplify the fear **** 
<p class="body">Into amplify</p>
<p class="body">If you buy into the hypothesis</p>
<p class="body">That for some reason</p>
<p class="body">There are incentives for the government</p>
<p class="body">To maintain the state of emergency</p>
<p class="body">That is 1 explanation given that those declarations are expiring and will have to be re implemented if 'cause if they're not</p>
<p class="body">Then all of this emergency use authorization vanishes, like dust</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So are you saying? </p>
<p class="body">Or are you implying that perhaps one of the reasons why they were moving monoclonal antibodies is to? </p>
<p class="body">Enhance the amount of people that are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Sick, I'm saying it is in the spectrum of the range of possible, just the same as the withholding of early treatments is inexplicable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And this is inexplicable in that we know that they're very effective</p>
<p class="body">I, I've personal evidence that they're very effective</p>
<p class="body">They work, they work great on me</p>
<p class="body">The fact that there are moving this and that you would even consider</p>
<p class="body">That the reason why they're doing it is to extend the emergency use authorization for political reasons is that's insane</p>
<p class="body">That's terrifying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's hard for me to reconcile</p>
<p class="body">The behavior of the government</p>
<p class="body">In its public health decisions with the data</p>
<p class="body">And I'm I'm it's it's you</p>
<p class="body">It's like there's two bins</p>
<p class="body">Is it incompetence or is it maleficence maleficence? </p>
<p class="body">Or are they is it is? </p>
<p class="body">Is there some ulterior political motive? </p>
<p class="body">Or they just</p>
<p class="body">Dumb stupid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If if there's some political motive, if that's written anywhere, someone is going to jail</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if that if that comes out, if that's somehow another gets leaked Jesus ******* Christ, that's scary</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That that, well, there's, there's you know</p>
<p class="body">So I wish it was so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I wish it was so too</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying that and I might be completely wrong</p>
<p class="body">I made me totally naive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Of what the lab leak? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the the the you know the for me? </p>
<p class="body">The disclosure of emails that Cliff Lane</p>
<p class="body">Tony Fauci and Francis Collins actively conspired to destroy any discussion of the appropriateness of lockdown strategies and in the mainstream press hardly covers it</p>
<p class="body">And there are no</p>
<p class="body">There are no consequences</p>
<p class="body">The document trail having to do with the gain of function research</p>
<p class="body">And the implication of NIH</p>
<p class="body">And by the way, dechra in that</p>
<p class="body">Having absolutely no consequences for anybody</p>
<p class="body">We're in an environment in which truth and consequences are fungible</p>
<p class="body">They this is modern media management and warfare</p>
<p class="body">The truth is what the those that are managing</p>
<p class="body">The Trusted News initiative say it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is wild</p>
<p class="body">And for me personally, it's so confusing that I find myself in a situation where I feel compelled to have people like you want, because I don't know where else this is gonna get out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't so so</p>
<p class="body">Thank you</p>
<p class="body">On behalf of, you know, in my case I'm the President of</p>
<p class="body">The International Alliance of Physicians and Scientists. We are over 16,000 people from all over the world. Physicians and scientists</p>
<p class="body">And you can find our website at WWW</p>
<p class="body">Dot globalcovidsummit.org</p>
<p class="body">We are gobsmacked about what's going on</p>
<p class="body">And we are shut down, censored, demeaned</p>
<p class="body">Fill in the blank</p>
<p class="body">All over the world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And over a period of two years, the world is completely changed in</p>
<p class="body">That regard</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And they're taking our licenses</p>
<p class="body">And license to practice medicine</p>
<p class="body">Because we are speaking about these matters and you can label me however you want to label me</p>
<p class="body">I don't care. I've done what I've done in my career. I'm at a stage at 62 years old</p>
<p class="body">I've got a farm</p>
<p class="body">It's almost paid off</p>
<p class="body">I raise horses</p>
<p class="body">I love my wife</p>
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">I've been married a long time</p>
<p class="body">My kids are both married</p>
<p class="body">I got grandkids</p>
<p class="body">You know, I don't need this</p>
<p class="body">I'm there's this claim I'm doing all this because I seek attention</p>
<p class="body">Trust me, this is not a fun thing to be doing</p>
<p class="body">At this stage</p>
<p class="body">Physicians at FLCC</p>
<p class="body">In senior positions highly like</p>
<p class="body">Peter McCullough, people at the at the culmination of exceptional careers</p>
<p class="body">Paul Merrick</p>
<p class="body">An exceptional physician by any standards</p>
<p class="body">Run out of his hospital, demeaned, destroyed, actively attacked, trying to take his license</p>
<p class="body">This is this medicine is being destroyed</p>
<p class="body">Globally, people are losing faith in the whole system</p>
<p class="body">They're losing faith in the scientific enterprise</p>
<p class="body">They're losing faith in our government</p>
<p class="body">They're losing faith in the vaccine enterprise</p>
<p class="body">I mean what is going to be the long term consequences of public health when you have a large fraction of the population who wasn't anti vaxxer that perjorative before that are now saying Oh my God? </p>
<p class="body">If this is how these people make decisions, I don't want anything to do with it</p>
<p class="body">I certainly don't want it jabbed into</p>
<p class="body">My kid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's one of the more disturbing things that the opposite of that is one of the more disturbing things about this pandemic is how people have just decided because they're scared and because they want a solution that the pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p class="body">Have their best interests at heart and that they're not these</p>
<p class="body">Machines that are designed to make money</p>
<p class="body">And they they sell drugs and the drugs are often beneficial, but their main goal is to make money</p>
<p class="body">And if they can fudge the data if they can move the numbers around</p>
<p class="body">If they can delete negative consequences</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Pfizer is one of the most criminal pharmaceutical</p>
<p class="body">Organizations in the world based on their past legal history</p>
<p class="body">In fines</p>
<p class="body">What are those fines include bribing physicians? </p>
<p class="body">It is a cost benefit analysis in the Pharmaceutical industry about misbehavior</p>
<p class="body">They are not grounded in the ethical principles that you and I as average people believe in</p>
<p class="body">They don't live in that world as you appropriately point out</p>
<p class="body">They are about profit return on investment</p>
<p class="body">And furthermore 
<p class="body">The Overlords that own them</p>
<p class="body">BlackRock Vanguard State Street, et cetera</p>
<p class="body">These large, massive funds that are completely decoupled from nation states have no moral core</p>
<p class="body">They have no moral purpose</p>
<p class="body">Their only purpose is return on investment</p>
<p class="body">And that is the core problem here</p>
<p class="body">That, and the fact that we as a society have become grossly fragmented through social media, electronic appliances, the stress of what we've experienced</p>
<p class="body">And this leads into this whole issue of mass formation psychosis that Matias Desmond</p>
<p class="body">The University of Ghent has promoted</p>
<p class="body">That for many of us, when Matthias, you know, psychologist and statistician interesting combination, came made public</p>
<p class="body">A lot of us as we listen to Matthias, we said oh that makes sense, that that was like the brain, that what happened when I encountered the trusted news initiative, I said, oh, you know, I don't know if you saw the Brett Weinstein podcast with me and Steve Kirsch</p>
<p class="body">Where that lit this whole fire all over the world, Bret ends with the with the basically the question if you listen to the long version</p>
<p class="body">What's how does this happen? </p>
<p class="body">How how do we have this emergent phenomena? </p>
<p class="body">The how question right? </p>
<p class="body">And you know behind the how question is the why question? </p>
<p class="body">That the</p>
<p class="body">The the how question of a third of the population basically being hypnotized</p>
<p class="body">In totally wrapped up in whatever Tony Fauci in the mainstream media feeds them whatever CNN tells them is true</p>
<p class="body">Let me illustrate that the other day I was looking through New York Times recent articles about Omicron and Pediatrics in preparation for this, and for making some slideshows</p>
<p class="body">And I saw this headline in the New York Times</p>
<p class="body">Epidemiologist in a vaccine ologist in the in the title was</p>
<p class="body">How you should think about children and omicron? </p>
<p class="body">It was, it was blatantly saying this is how you should think we're going to tell you how to think</p>
<p class="body">OK, people kind of gotta get that in their head</p>
<p class="body">That's the world we're in right now</p>
<p class="body">Now, what Matthias Desmond has has shared with us</p>
<p class="body">Brilliant Insight is another one of those aahe</p>
<p class="body">Now that</p>
<p class="body">Part makes sense</p>
<p class="body">Which is that? </p>
<p class="body">This comes from basically European intellectual inquiry into what the heck happened in Germany</p>
<p class="body">In the 20s and 30s, you know very intelligent, highly educated population and they went barking mad</p>
<p class="body">And how did that happen? </p>
<p class="body">The answer is mass formation psychosis</p>
<p class="body">When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other</p>
<p class="body">And has free floating anxiety in a sense that things don't make sense</p>
<p class="body">We can't understand it</p>
<p class="body">And then their attention gets focused by a leader or a series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis</p>
<p class="body">They literally become hypnotized and can be LED anywhere</p>
<p class="body">And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that they identify as their leaders</p>
<p class="body">The ones typically that come in and say you have this pain and I can solve it for you</p>
<p class="body">I and I alone</p>
<p class="body">OK, I can fix this problem for you</p>
<p class="body">OK then they will lead</p>
<p class="body">They will follow that person through hell</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter whether they lie to him or whatever</p>
<p class="body">The data are irrelevant, and furthermore anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked</p>
<p class="body">They are the other</p>
<p class="body">This is central to mass formation psychosis and this is what has happened. We had all those conditions. If you remember back before 2019, everybody was complaining. The world doesn't make sense</p>
<p class="body">Blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">And we're all isolated from each other</p>
<p class="body">We're all on our little tools</p>
<p class="body">We're not connected socially anymore except through social media</p>
<p class="body">And then this thing happened and everybody focused on it</p>
<p class="body">That is how mass formation psychosis happens</p>
<p class="body">And that is what's happened here</p>
<p class="body">Now there's ways to get out of it</p>
<p class="body">Matias recommendation is you've got to get people to realize that what we've got is a situation of</p>
<p class="body">Global totalitarianism 
<p class="body">In his experience in Europe</p>
<p class="body">Making people realize there's a bigger threat than the virus</p>
<p class="body">Can cause a separation psychologically</p>
<p class="body">In this fusion this hypnosis that has happened</p>
<p class="body">The problem is then you're just substituting a bigger boogeyman from the current one</p>
<p class="body">And somebody else can come in and manipulate that the real problem, and it gets back to your core point</p>
<p class="body">We're sick as a society and we have to heal ourselves</p>
<p class="body">And one of the things we have to do</p>
<p class="body">Is come together</p>
<p class="body">We have to recreate our social bonds</p>
<p class="body">We have to</p>
<p class="body">Buy into integrity</p>
<p class="body">The importance of human dignity</p>
<p class="body">And the importance of community</p>
<p class="body">That's how we get out of this</p>
<p class="body">And I think that this inside of Matias Desmond</p>
<p class="body">Is really central to kind of making sense out of all of this crazy</p>
<p class="body">We got a world in which the press is incentivized</p>
<p class="body">To push a storyline because they're all controlled by the same large funds</p>
<p class="body">That Pfizer is and so is tech</p>
<p class="body">I don't know how we're going to get out of it, but it's got to start with us</p>
<p class="body">All of us finding common ground</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think one way we're going to get out of it is by realizing what it is</p>
<p class="body">And by the way you just explained it in the way Peter McCullough explained it when he was on the podcast</p>
<p class="body">As well, this mass formation psychosis that we're currently experiencing</p>
<p class="body">Most people are unaware that's even happening</p>
<p class="body">All these events take place and it's this perfect storm</p>
<p class="body">Of the social media aspect of it, the the fact that we are disconnected the the COVID, the separation, the isolation from society, the lockdowns</p>
<p class="body">Also coming off of the four years of Trump where we're so polarized politically and this</p>
<p class="body">It's become</p>
<p class="body">Not just common but accepted to other people to to point at those the others</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's the Republicans or the Democrats or the independents</p>
<p class="body">Whatever you choose, whatever you choose to make, or the unvaccinated that was going to get to, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Or the OR the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's one of the things that</p>
<p class="body">I find very bizarre about the tribal aspect of this is that people want me to get vaccinated and like my friends who've been vaccinated, want me to join the team like go ahead, get the tattoo like what are you saying? </p>
<p class="body">And I'm like I've gone through the virus</p>
<p class="body">I have immunity</p>
<p class="body">I also have antibodies</p>
<p class="body">I just checked them last week like I could show you the test</p>
<p class="body">A matter of fact, I have it right here</p>
<p class="body">There it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And I had to be tested when I came in the front door at</p>
<p class="body">Your shop here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we test everybody, but the point being is it doesn't make any sense for me to get vaccinated</p>
<p class="body">But they want me to join</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's worse than that</p>
<p class="body">It puts you at higher risk</p>
<p class="body">Yes, OK, they're asking you to take more risk</p>
<p class="body">For your health</p>
<p class="body">In order to join their club</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's what it is, and that's what it is, and it's a it's a tribal formation</p>
<p class="body">It's people who don't have personal sovereignty and people who aren't confident with standing by their own thoughts and objectively analyzing things outside of, uh, an ideology outside of the tribe</p>
<p class="body">Those people are very susceptible right now, and those are more common than not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So Joe again, this is not me buttering you up</p>
<p class="body">This is, This is why you're providing such a service to your country and to humanity</p>
<p class="body">Because you're one of the few voices</p>
<p class="body">That has a an audience</p>
<p class="body">That is not Democrat or Republican or black or white, or vaccinated or unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">All these dipoles that we create artificially</p>
<p class="body">And you are trying to speak to that persuadable middle</p>
<p class="body">In and do so with with an open heart</p>
<p class="body">In an open mind</p>
<p class="body">And in a world in which all of the information is being so carefully manipulated</p>
<p class="body">And so pervasively distorted</p>
<p class="body">And and I, I'm grateful sincerely</p>
<p class="body">My colleagues are grateful</p>
<p class="body">And and I think the world should be grateful for your leadership</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I'm very grateful that there's courageous people like yourself that do put your reputations and your careers on the line by speaking out against this stuff when it is very difficult</p>
<p class="body">And when you do get deep platform for doing that, they know that by censoring you, they're not</p>
<p class="body">Just censoring you</p>
<p class="body">They're also making others like you</p>
<p class="body">Self censor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Absolutely absolutely</p>
<p class="body">I've been self censoring for months</p>
<p class="body">I mean every morning when we post on Twitter, my wife and I, Jill Glasspool Malone, PhD, right? </p>
<p class="body">I have this active</p>
<p class="body">Can we post this? </p>
<p class="body">Not you know how do we say this? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So we're not going to get deep platformed blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p class="body">We're constantly self censoring</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's crazy because you're self censoring about your area of expertise</p>
<p class="body">Which is insane because the people who are censoring you don't have any education in it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It yes, I agree it's insane</p>
<p class="body">It's the world we're in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm just hoping that that clip where you explained this mass formation psychosis makes the rounds and I think everything you've laid out today is about as clear and as rational and as well documented as</p>
<p class="body">I could have hoped and more so thank you very much for being here</p>
<p class="body">Thank you very much for everything that you've done and Jesus Christ Twitter</p>
<p class="body">Put the ******* guy back on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's OK, you know so</p>
<p class="body">So you do martial arts</p>
<p class="body">And so you get the idea of using your opponent's energy against</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Him yes, OK? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">I was immediately contacted by multiple lawyers</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure this this could be an excellent exemplar case</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think it is between you and Alex Berenson</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Who's already filed one? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, OK, I've I've been through the legal grind</p>
<p class="body">I don't want to sue anybody frankly, but it is</p>
<p class="body">It just sucks the blood out of you</p>
<p class="body">Not to mention your financial resources</p>
<p class="body">I mean it's just a ugly process</p>
<p class="body">I hate it</p>
<p class="body">There's two hills that are willing</p>
<p class="body">I'm willing to die on</p>
<p class="body">One is stopping the jabs and the children</p>
<p class="body">And one is</p>
<p class="body">You know, resisting</p>
<p class="body">The erosion of free speech</p>
<p class="body">Which is the fundamental principle on which our democracy and our society civilized Western culture is built on? </p>
<p class="body">I like to say when I give rallies do you remember back a couple of years ago when you felt sorry for the people in the People's Republic of China? </p>
<p class="body">Their Internet was filtered</p>
<p class="body">They weren't allowed free speech</p>
<p class="body">Their government told them what to do and think</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">Now here we are</p>
<p class="body">OK, and the next thing that we all feel sorry about social credit system</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">Wake up folks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wake up it's coming</p>
<p class="body">If we give into this and we give into vaccine passports and having an app on your phone that shows everything you're doing in in terms of your medical history, and they've even offered people extra credit, there was a article on Yahoo about having access to your browser history and they they framed it in this very positive way that having access to your browser in history may</p>
<p class="body">Allow you to receive extra credit</p>
<p class="body">So you would be available you would you</p>
<p class="body">You would have credit available to buy a home or a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Car so bingo OK we already know what social credit systems feel like</p>
<p class="body">We call it a credit rating agencies, OK? </p>
<p class="body">And you know what? </p>
<p class="body">Those guys do</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't matter whether or not if it's on, your record doesn't matter whether or not you did it or what the extenuating circumstances were, it's in their algorithm and you will get your score and your score basically will determine the tax on your access to credit in the form of the interest that you pay on the money that</p>
<p class="body">They have been given by the federal government</p>
<p class="body">OK, that's the way this ecosystem works</p>
<p class="body">They get that money at a huge discount and then they decide how worthy you are to receive it</p>
<p class="body">If you want to have credit</p>
<p class="body">And so if you want to understand a little tiny version of the social credit system, it's right there in your credit score</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think the only thing that helps us here is that this may be the one subject where</p>
<p class="body">Everyone loses people on the left</p>
<p class="body">People on the right, people in the center, everyone loses if they impart a social credit system</p>
<p class="body">If there is some sort of social credit app that you have to carry around on your phone that determines where you're allowed to go, what you're allowed to do, we're all gonna lose, no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I disagree</p>
<p class="body">The oligarchs win</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A very small percentage of the population wins</p>
<p class="body">Yes, right? </p>
<p class="body">But I mean the the general public, the people, the people that are divided about COVID the people that are now othering each other and you know you losers who got the jab and look at you</p>
<p class="body">Unvaccinated playgrounds</p>
<p class="body">This nonsense is going on</p>
<p class="body">Maybe this will be the one thing that unites us 'cause we realize that this</p>
<p class="body">Is tyranny, or if it won't come? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Welcome to the new boss</p>
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">Welcome to the new Overlords guys</p>
<p class="body">And it's your choice I'm I'm gonna be dead</p>
<p class="body">You know I'm I'm 62</p>
<p class="body">It's it's my thanks, you're kind</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You got some years in you bro</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">That it's our children</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Settle in it's</p>
<p class="body">I mean, they're</p>
<p class="body">There's they're challenged uniquely already because they are growing up with social media</p>
<p class="body">They're growing up with Tik T.O.K and these invasive apps that are tracking all their movement and everything they do and buy and see and what they look up and they cross platform</p>
<p class="body">They they share this data across platform</p>
<p class="body">It's very sketchy stuff and that the fact that it's happened and it happened so quickly and that our data which seemed to be nothing became one of the most valuable commodities in the world</p>
<p class="body">And that and that data is used to manipulate</p>
<p class="body">All the people on the planet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">So we're touching on some deep stuff about the kids and I'm forgive me for an unabashed</p>
<p class="body">For the Unity project, which I serve as chief medical and regulatory officer for so that's</p>
<p class="body">Unity project online</p>
<p class="body">Com or org it's com</p>
<p class="body">We're totally focused on the kids</p>
<p class="body">And if you go on that site</p>
<p class="body">You'll see a podcast that I did with a pediatric</p>
<p class="body">Psychiatrist out of LA</p>
<p class="body">And a pediatric</p>
<p class="body">Cardiologist who's also a pH</p>
<p class="body">D in vascular inflammation, Kurt milhoan</p>
<p class="body">And I got those two guys on to talk about what's happening to our children</p>
<p class="body">In particular</p>
<p class="body">The psychological damage</p>
<p class="body">Of these lockdowns this mask use</p>
<p class="body">The school policies</p>
<p class="body">The bullying of children who are unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">The psychological damage is huge</p>
<p class="body">We're having a worldwide epidemic of suicide in children</p>
<p class="body">We are having a huge surge of drug abuse in adolescents</p>
<p class="body">We're having demonstrable drops in IQ and fundamental developmental milestones</p>
<p class="body">In the very young</p>
<p class="body">Like 20 IQ points</p>
<p class="body">OK, children have to see faces to learn how to speak and to interact socially</p>
<p class="body">You're talking about social intelligence, which you're deep in</p>
<p class="body">And connectedness we're raising a generation of children in that have been blocked from their ability because their brains are developing extremely rapidly at this age</p>
<p class="body">The ability for their brains to assimilate the information necessary for them to become functional citizens</p>
<p class="body">And parents</p>
<p class="body">We're destroying it without a second thought</p>
<p class="body">And the damage is going to last for generations and</p>
<p class="body">Is if that's not bad enough, we're allowing the state to insert itself into the family</p>
<p class="body">And make decisions by mandating vaccination</p>
<p class="body">OK, This is why this these childhood vaccines mandates are obscene</p>
<p class="body">We're setting up a situation in which children are going to see peers who have been vaccine damaged as a consequence of the policies that their teachers and their government have forced on them</p>
<p class="body">The the damage here</p>
<p class="body">Is going to be with us for generations</p>
<p class="body">I'm not being chicken little here</p>
<p class="body">This is deep, profound stuff</p>
<p class="body">It's way beyond myocarditis</p>
<p class="body">In no one seems to care</p>
<p class="body">No one talks to children</p>
<p class="body">There was a big breakthrough</p>
<p class="body">We all celebrated a week ago, Face the Nation</p>
<p class="body">What on the on the annual Roundup of of stories that have been underreported? </p>
<p class="body">One of the speakers got up journalists and and said to the other group, I think one of the most underreported stories has been the damage that's happened to our children</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I saw that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And did you see what happened with the other journalists? </p>
<p class="body">Nobody said a word</p>
<p class="body">They moved on</p>
<p class="body">It was hardly covered in media</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, she even glossed over the damage by the vaccines</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Agreed, how she? </p>
<p class="body">How could she speak about the vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">I suspect she may lose her job</p>
<p class="body">She's not gonna be invited back on that program again</p>
<p class="body">I doubt</p>
<p class="body">I mean, how could she speak about the damage of the vaccines? </p>
<p class="body">It is already</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">She did she really just briefly touched</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">On this and she</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so so</p>
<p class="body">Probably 'cause it's dangerous, insanely dangerous to speak truth to power right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Before we wrap this up, why is the vaccine uniquely dangerous to children? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Good question that the and I'm not completely so</p>
<p class="body">The data</p>
<p class="body">Here's the problem with the myocarditis bias in children in</p>
<p class="body">The data set, particularly boys</p>
<p class="body">One of the things there is clearly an androgen component to the risk of both the vaccine and the disease of the the virus</p>
<p class="body">And that's why anti androgens, by the way Pierre Corey shout out to him for a champion of anti androgens, androgens being added to his math plus protocol</p>
<p class="body">OK, particularly for men</p>
<p class="body">Why are boys there? </p>
<p class="body">There's probably a component of that that has to do with an artifact in the data</p>
<p class="body">That being that, when a sold coudures in general, is a population have a much higher risk of cardiac events, and so if there's a heart attack in in one of us</p>
<p class="body">It's really hard to say</p>
<p class="body">Is it just because we're old? </p>
<p class="body">Or is it a vaccine related? </p>
<p class="body">OK, so then the vaccine if there are vaccine related events buried in that</p>
<p class="body">We're not going to see him statistically</p>
<p class="body">It's really hard to pull it out, whereas kids don't have heart attacks and they don't have strokes, so you can see those things really clearly against the background of virtually nothing, so that's it may be partially an artifact of reporting and bias because of confounding variables, and it may be there</p>
<p class="body">Other effects</p>
<p class="body">In terms of your broader question, moving outside of the myocarditis, why are children more susceptible to these adverse events? </p>
<p class="body">I think they're not</p>
<p class="body">I think the problem is that we're seeing it in the kids, but it's present in the adult population also</p>
<p class="body">I think there is a significant reporting bias going on against reporting adult vaccine injury</p>
<p class="body">I think that we have more in in how why would I say that? </p>
<p class="body">Oh, because I'm a vaccine denier</p>
<p class="body">I'm a bad guy and I have some perverse incentive to have that media hit me know we have these reports from hospitalists and nurses, the ones that often it's the nurses</p>
<p class="body">They're able to speak for some reason</p>
<p class="body">The nurses are disclosing things that they're seeing in their hospitals, and the physicians are all shutting up</p>
<p class="body">Is it because they have financial incentives or because they're all owned because they have such debt burdens? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">But the nurses are speaking out and they're saying, hey, we're seeing strokes and heart attacks in these other types of problems that are known to be associated with the jabs</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's hard to say</p>
<p class="body">Because we got the virus in the in</p>
<p class="body">The vaccines overlapping, you know, is it chicken or egg? </p>
<p class="body">We know that they're happening</p>
<p class="body">We know that the deaths are happening</p>
<p class="body">That's like the the</p>
<p class="body">Excuses that are made about the sudden deaths in high performing athletes</p>
<p class="body">That are being observed all over the world, particularly in footballers</p>
<p class="body">That where they're just suddenly dropping, is it because they've been infected or they because they've been jabbed? </p>
<p class="body">In and I think it's a mixture of both</p>
<p class="body">But if it's from the vaccines, the thing about the vaccines is that's in, you know we have this principle we used to</p>
<p class="body">Of do no harm</p>
<p class="body">In in</p>
<p class="body">If a if a virus naturally infects you and you have a damage from it, I haven't caused that damage as a physician</p>
<p class="body">If I'm recommending that you take a drug</p>
<p class="body">An intervention they didn't need to have</p>
<p class="body">You may or may not have gotten infected, and it causes damage</p>
<p class="body">Well, I got to kind of own that</p>
<p class="body">As a physician, as a representative of the medical industrial complex and a participant in it</p>
<p class="body">And so</p>
<p class="body">For whatever reason, there's an underreporting bias</p>
<p class="body">Clearly, in the adult population</p>
<p class="body">And I think that people be me a little more sensitive to adverse events and deaths in their children</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Robert, thank you for everything</p>
<p class="body">I really appreciate you</p>
<p class="body">I appreciate you being here</p>
<p class="body">If people want to read more of your work now that you've been banned from Twitter, where are you? </p>
<p class="body">Where are you? </p>
<p class="body">Are you still on LinkedIn or you gone? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">From LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">Still on LinkedIn I'm I'm really cautious on LinkedIn</p>
<p class="body">I'm like I'm on getter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sub stack</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">And I'm on sub stack, so that's RW Malone, MD</p>
<p class="body">And who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sub stacks probably the best place though, right? </p>
<p class="body">The least censored</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">It's the the problem with sub stack</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it is least censored and and I would love more sub stack subscriptions, but I have a financial conflict of interest there so I don't want to pump it</p>
<p class="body">But that is I try to use sub stack for more in depth intellectual pieces</p>
<p class="body">Thought pieces, not just I mean Alex bless his heart</p>
<p class="body">He blasts everything out as if sub stack is Twitter</p>
<p class="body">It's not my style, right? </p>
<p class="body">So I'm going to be using getter for that thread getter</p>

<p class="body">What is that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a that's a Twitter alternative</p>
<p class="body">We don't know about getter</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, no, it's it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Been waiting for one though</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yep, so I'm using getter and and again at at RW Malone, MD</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So is it? </p>
<p class="body">Is it spelled like? </p>
<p class="body">GTR GT GTR</p>
<p class="body">Do you want it, Jamie, no GTR</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so getter is is branded as the Twitter killer</p>
<p class="body">It is explicitly a Twitter alternative</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it all right wing crazy people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dr. Robert Malone </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's it's a lot</p>
<p class="body">It's a lot of people that have been, it's yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That a lot of people that kicked</p>
