<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Dakota salmon brotherhood</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Brother, how are you gonna? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">See it, what's? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Up man, you wrote a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Book man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">At the end I did with with Bravo Neil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">The way forward yeah master life toughest battles and create your lasting legacy</p>
<p class="body">What, uh? </p>
<p class="body">What drove you to this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">You know, like I I I think that there was like a point in my life to where I kind of just</p>
<p class="body">You know, kind of put it all together like wanting to help people you know, like the way forward. There's always a way forward. You know my my life's been such a shitshow so many ways</p>
<p class="body">And obviously Rob has to</p>
<p class="body">That was one thing we could relate on</p>
<p class="body">Is like you know, we both came from two different places, did two different things, but like there's always a way forward and you know, focusing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">On what matters was there a time in your life where you? </p>
<p class="body">Didn't think there was a way forward where you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, I mean I, I wrote about that in my first book about, you know, a time that</p>
<p class="body">I just didn't know if there was a way forward, but you know what would I? </p>
<p class="body">What I learned was, is like you know, when you don't see a way forward, it's because your purpose is yourself and it's not other things, right? </p>
<p class="body">People that people that are lost or I feel like when I'm lost is when I'm too busy focusing on things for me and my</p>
<p class="body">My purpose is me and it's not like the things that are around me</p>
<p class="body">The things that matter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Like I went, what do you mean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">You know, like my kids, like my friends, my circle, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like doing something bigger than me like focusing on something that's that's bigger than than just, you know, trying to survive like? </p>
<p class="body">OK, well I'm going to go pay my bills, so that's not really a great purpose, right? </p>
<p class="body">But but finding something bigger that you could believe in</p>
<p class="body">Like you know, being a firefighter or being a good dad or you know just the trying to have goals of fitness or start a company or all those things, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">So did you feel like that at one point in time where? </p>
<p class="body">You were only thinking about yourself and you didn't see there was any point to at</p>
<p class="body">All is that what you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, I mean I got other marine core and</p>
<p class="body">You know I got out and it was all about me, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's like, oh, you know I, I served this country</p>
<p class="body">This country owes me now</p>
<p class="body">You know 'cause look when you're in the military, you're</p>
<p class="body">The whole time you're told you're a hero, yeah, you know, I mean like oh everybody, just they're they're you're just you're just greater people you know or all these things you sacrifice for this country this country owes you and I hate that word owes</p>
<p class="body">Right like oh, the only thing we owe is the bank</p>
<p class="body">You know that that was where I was at and I was walking around blaming all my problems on, you know, well, you know, I mean, you know I'm drinking all the time</p>
<p class="body">Wasn't alcoholic, but just drinking all the time trying to, you know, overcome the pain of you know the stuff that I've seen</p>
<p class="body">The things that didn't make sense and and then you know when you would try to question me or hold me accountable be like, well, you didn't go through what I went through</p>
<p class="body">Right, and so how you gonna argue it? </p>
<p class="body">You know, when I was surrounded by that I was that was the victim I made myself the victim of of life</p>
<p class="body">And you know at that point was where I got the lowest, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I, I just, couldn't you know? </p>
'cause at some point like people were going to, they're going to try to help you like that's the great thing about the world</p>
<p class="body">Is people going to help you? </p>
<p class="body">People want to help? </p>
<p class="body">But they can only help you so far, like they're not gonna drown with you, especially when you're not choosing to to get better</p>
<p class="body">And that was where I was at, you know, like just drinking all the time</p>
<p class="body">You know, being I was, I was an ******* like</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I'm still an asset, but just a different way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I was an ******* and just</p>
<p class="body">You know blaming, blaming the world for my problems when really I was the problem</p>
<p class="body">You know, I just didn't have anything bigger than me and I would surround myself by people who would who wanted to coddle me, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like all Dakota, you know what you've gone through? </p>
<p class="body">You know you you deserve, you know you're it's it's OK this is normal for what you've gone through and it's like no, no, no like</p>
<p class="body">That's what America is about</p>
<p class="body">Is the comeback story right? </p>
<p class="body">Like everybody is going to go through their problems</p>
<p class="body">Everybody is going to have their lumps, but America, they they want the comeback story</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">No, I am, you know. So I was living at my dad's house. I was living with my dad. My dad is just an incredible man</p>
<p class="body">And one night I was out drinking somewhere and I was driving home on this road and I just seen like the pain I was causing the people around me right like</p>
<p class="body">My dad was never gonna kick me out of the house, but I I mean</p>
<p class="body">I just seen, like the disappointment, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like the disappointment in people that I was that I was bringing and I was driving down the road one night and</p>
<p class="body">I just say look, this is it like I'm done</p>
<p class="body">I pulled over at my buddy shop</p>
<p class="body">He had a welding shop and I 'cause I knew that I didn't want to inconvenience anybody to have to</p>
<p class="body">Well, where's he at this huge search? I knew he would be in at 866 to 8:00 in the morning. He comes in every day</p>
<p class="body">I pulled over and</p>
<p class="body">Parked right in front of the Bay door and</p>
<p class="body">Pulled my gun out and I stuck it to my head and squeeze the trigger</p>
<p class="body">And like somebody had unloaded that gun, I'd shot it that day</p>
<p class="body">Actually, I'd shot this Glock 40 that day</p>
<p class="body">And it was the loudest click I've ever heard my life and probably the quickest sobering thing that I've ever seen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Holy ****
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And so I sat there and</p>
    <p class="body">I just told myself that if I'm going to continue to live life like I am and waste it</p>
    <p class="body">Then I know how to load this gun</p>
    <p class="body">I need to just track it back</p>
    <p class="body">And get it over with</p>
    <p class="body">But I just made this deal with myself that if I'm gonna put put the car in drive and go home</p>
    <p class="body">That, like this is not an option ever again</p>
    <p class="body">You know God gave me a different, had a different, different different outcome for me and I drove home and ever since then I mean, I mean, you know, look, I think we all</p>
    <p class="body">I think we all</p>
    <p class="body">Go through moments where we don't know like there's always these moments where we don't know if we can get out of it right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like that's normal, yeah</p>
    <p class="body">But for that to stay that way</p>
    <p class="body">Is not normal</p>
    <p class="body">Right and</p>
    <p class="body">That was, you know, I</p>
    <p class="body">I like slowed up on drinking</p>
    <p class="body">I didn't stop</p>
    <p class="body">Obviously, I didn't really slow up as where I needed to be until I had my child</p>
    <p class="body">But I got a lot better, right? </p>
    <p class="body">I started surrounding myself with different people</p>
    <p class="body">People who weren't going to buy in and support</p>
    <p class="body">My ********
        <p class="body">You know? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So that</p>
        <p class="body">Moment when the gun went click</p>
        <p class="body">Like in your mind, is there like a clear change between before that moment and after that moment? </p>
        <p class="body">Was there like a? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, was it, uh, there was</p>
        <p class="body">There, uh, was</p>
        <p class="body">It like a realization was, it was just like you felt like you got a second chance at</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Life like yeah, I mean look I've</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean I've been in so many situations where I was supposed to die, or I thought I'd like</p>
        <p class="body">There's been</p>
        <p class="body">At least five or six situations where it wasn't that I thought I was going to die</p>
        <p class="body">It was that I knew I was going to die</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">In combat situations</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">The combat situations, right? </p>
        <p class="body">It's totally different experience though</p>
        <p class="body">You know this one was like</p>
        <p class="body">As I get like like why? </p>
        <p class="body">Like you know, and I think at</p>
        <p class="body">That moment I realized</p>
        <p class="body">That I was only feeling sorry for myself because if my teammates like if losing my teammates</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I mean, it sucks like it still sucks</p>
        <p class="body">Like I, I sometimes I don't even know if I have even</p>
        <p class="body">Came to the realization that I'll never see my guys again</p>
        <p class="body">And I don't know why</p>
        <p class="body">It's kind of weird, but you know, I don't know why</p>
        <p class="body">I think that like I just realized that I need to live a life if I don't want to do it for myself, then I need to live a life that's worthy of their sacrifices</p>
        <p class="body">Right, like how stupid is it? </p>
        <p class="body">How selfish of</p>
        <p class="body">It of me</p>
        <p class="body">Someone who has seen what the cost of freedom is or someone who has seen the sacrifices that people have gave who don't get it, don't get it</p>
        <p class="body">Tomorrow they gave there today so that we can have it tomorrow and how selfish of it is for me to walk around and and and, you know, be a drunk ******* And that's the representation that I'm going to represent</p>
        <p class="body">Their sacrifices like it's, it's just</p>
        <p class="body">It's such a</p>
        <p class="body">It's just not right, and that was at that moment that all that started to come together</p>
        <p class="body">No, no, I just feel sorry for myself, not them</p>
        <p class="body">They don't feel anything</p>
        <p class="body">So I'm feeling sorry for myself and as I'm doing that, I'm wasting days that that they I guarantee they wish they had</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">It's such a common problem with veterans</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I believe at one point in time I don't know what the the status is now, but at one point in time more veterans had died by suicide in Afghanistan then had died from combat</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean I've lost</p>
        <p class="body">More guys</p>
        <p class="body">Since being home to suicide than I ever lost in combat</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">What is? </p>
        <p class="body">Let's see what the number is, so if you can find</p>
        <p class="body">There I think just just Google more veterans die from suicide than combat, 'cause I think that was</p>
        <p class="body">What they were trying to drill into people is that asking people to go over there and fight and to see the horrors that they see and to to see friends die and loved ones die and then ask them to come back and have life just be normal</p>
        <p class="body">Look at this four times as many troops</p>
        <p class="body">And vets have died by suicide as in combat</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, holy **** yeah</p>
        <p class="body">So this is not a an uncommon problem</p>
        <p class="body">It's a it's a giant problem</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, it's I mean</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">It's a huge problem, they don't</p>
        <p class="body">I don't mean I don't know what kind of training they give you when you're about to leave the military military</p>
        <p class="body">Or when they're when you're returning from combat</p>
        <p class="body">But do they try to give you any sort of an understanding of how to cope with this? </p>
        <p class="body">Kind of stuff</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean you know it's it's obviously gotten a lot better, right? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, it was more the tough love</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, it's more the more that mental health is accepted</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I mean you look, I mean to be honest</p>
        <p class="body">I mean as men</p>
        10-15 years ago it wasn't something it was looked at as weak, right?
    </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">I it</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You didn't hear a lot about it</p>
    <p class="body">It seems like somewhere along the line</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I don't know what the statistics show, but it seems like somewhere along the line it became way more common to know people to kill themselves</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah yeah, I mean and I I didn't understand</p>
    <p class="body">I didn't know about it until obviously the military right? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I went in at 17</p>
    <p class="body">And dumb</p>
    <p class="body">But no, there wasn't a lot of talk about it and</p>
    <p class="body">You know, the more, the more we were in combat, the more you started to</p>
    <p class="body">See it right and we</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean this thing of PTSD, but I mean PTSD is something that that the world suffers from</p>
    <p class="body">It's not something that's only to veterans, right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Don't you think that veterans have it in a larger experience? </p>
    <p class="body">If you experience combat, I mean the amount that they have</p>
    <p class="body">I mean so many guys that I know</p>
    <p class="body">Like yourself for</p>
    <p class="body">Some money</p>
    <p class="body">My other friends that are veterans they just have</p>
    <p class="body">Memories that they can't shake</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I think that you want to talk about the group of people that have it the worst</p>
    <p class="body">Is our first responders</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Cops klimts yeah yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Cops, firefighters, EMTs like like</p>
    <p class="body">The stuff that I've seen as being a firefighter</p>
    <p class="body">Sometimes, like combat was, it's no comparison</p>
    <p class="body">Really yeah, I mean and so</p>
    <p class="body">You know, in in over there the mind like the, you know the mindsets, different right like like I mean most of the people that we were part of</p>
    <p class="body">Like we were there to fight, right? </p>
    <p class="body">So it's it's like it's it's almost like you know watching someone in the Octagon fight versus watching someone on a street fight, you know, get jumped right</p>
    <p class="body">It's it's</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It's a different ball game and</p>
    <p class="body">You know? </p>
    <p class="body">Everybody suffering right? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, and so I think that like the mental health aspect, yeah, I mean, it's a huge huge thing</p>
    <p class="body">But I also think that</p>
    <p class="body">That the mindset</p>
    <p class="body">The approach that we take on it is important as well, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like like I don't need to</p>
    <p class="body">I don't need to</p>
    <p class="body">I don't need to be coddled right like OK, I have</p>
    <p class="body">I have PTSD check</p>
    <p class="body">But that doesn't give me like a card to blame</p>
    <p class="body">Well why I'm an alcoholic or why I'm not getting help or or why I hit my wife or why I'm in fight so you know I mean like, well, let's get help like like let's get help and let's want to get better</p>
    <p class="body">You know there's just a fine line of</p>
    <p class="body">Of using it as an excuse versus as what's what's real on it right? </p>
    <p class="body">And no one can identify that, but it's like at some point you have to look in the mirror and want</p>
    <p class="body">I mean look Jocko talks about extreme ownership, right? </p>
    <p class="body">You have to look in the mirror and at the point that you can take responsibility for your actions, you can then change them</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">So when you think about PTSD and you think about the effect</p>
    <p class="body">That it has on you</p>
    <p class="body">Being a firefight, does it compound all of the the PTSD that you experience as a combat veteran? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean does it, is it? </p>
    <p class="body">Is it? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I don't know like how was that this was a conversation I was having this morning</p>
    <p class="body">I I don't know like</p>
    <p class="body">For me, I've changed my mindset for me</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean there are some stuff that bothers me</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, obviously I look every time it changes you</p>
    <p class="body">Or for me it does and</p>
    <p class="body">But now I look at it like when I come in and and and I'm with</p>
    <p class="body">I'm there when somebody you know passes away</p>
    <p class="body">I I look at it as an honor</p>
    <p class="body">Right like I I got to share that moment with them and as long as I can do, I'm doing whatever I can to make that moment</p>
    <p class="body">Better for them</p>
    <p class="body">Then that's all I can do right, and I'll do whatever it takes to make that moment better</p>
    <p class="body">But at some point</p>
    <p class="body">We have we really have no control of anything in life</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">We have some control, right? </p>
    <p class="body">But yeah, those kind of experiences like the experience of seeing someone die</p>
    <p class="body">For a lot of people it it doesn't just change you, but it it makes you</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't know</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">What the best way to say it is? </p>
    <p class="body">But you're just devastated by it and every time it happens, it becomes compounded</p>
    <p class="body">It's more and more and more</p>
    <p class="body">And is there like one of the things that I've thought about a lot with police officers 'cause I feel like</p>
    <p class="body">Like there's bad cops</p>
    <p class="body">We all know there's bad cops just like there's bad everything else in life</p>
    <p class="body">But I think that most cops are</p>
    <p class="body">The experiences that they have in situations where their life is threatened</p>
    <p class="body">Situation where they pull people over</p>
    <p class="body">They have no idea if this person has a gun</p>
    <p class="body">If this person is a criminal, they they</p>
    <p class="body">They just don't know there's so many moments in their life where they</p>
    <p class="body">They've I'm sure they've seen all the YouTube videos</p>
    <p class="body">That I've seen</p>
    <p class="body">You know where cops get shot at and cops get killed and run over by cars and all that crazy ****

        <p class="body">Very very very difficult job</p>
        <p class="body">And I don't think it gets nearly the respect that it deserves, and all we concentrate on is the ones that suck the the cops that suck at their job</p>
        <p class="body">The cops that are ******** or the cops that are abusive and that's what we think about</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">That's it</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">We did, you know? </p>
        <p class="body">We think about cops that plant evidence cops that shoot people unnecessarily</p>
        <p class="body">That's all we</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Think about because they're the only ones</p>
        <p class="body">They get attention, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like they're the only ones you see</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, it's kind of like everything</p>
        <p class="body">It's kinda like everything like like you only see the bad ones</p>
        <p class="body">The media loves to focus on the bad ones because guess what? </p>
        <p class="body">Feet and fear</p>
        <p class="body">Makes money</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I I truly believed it</p>
        <p class="body">Look and and love will go further than hate and fear</p>
        <p class="body">Love, love, love</p>
        100% Go further right and
    </p>
    <p class="body">But hate and fear every like</p>
    <p class="body">Think about anytime you feel fear or you hate</p>
    <p class="body">That was put into you by somebody else 90% of the time. Like look at this stuff we're scared of</p>
    <p class="body">Because somebody told us</p>
    <p class="body">Right because? </p>
    <p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
    <p class="body">It's like like what? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Kind of stuff</p>
    <p class="body">Do you mean I mean like? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't know like</p>
    <p class="body">Sometimes I you know I'll get anxiety about</p>
    <p class="body">Well, I mean, we're just like right now like, well, you know</p>
    <p class="body">Well, let's go pull our how about this toilet paper</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You get anxiety out toilet paper</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">No, I'm no</p>
    <p class="body">I'm saying like no, no no</p>
    <p class="body">I'm saying like no</p>
    <p class="body">I'm saying like whenever whenever the pandemic hit</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Right, you know? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It's contagious, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like freaking out fear is contagious</p>
    <p class="body">Somebody seeing somebody go buy toilet paper and it's like then they say you know toilet paper is all out right like</p>
    <p class="body">Like it's it's all</p>
    <p class="body">These things are contagious and it's like fear sales fear</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean what like if you thought about it</p>
    <p class="body">What was toilet paper going to do for you in this right? </p>
    <p class="body">And at the end of the day? </p>
    <p class="body">At the end of the day, like we could live without toilet paper, you know what I mean? </p>
    <p class="body">Like it's not a survival instinct</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I think what happened during the pandemic was people were tested in a way that they had never been tested before</p>
    <p class="body">Like we had, we had never experienced a moment in our life where there was a real fear that society was going to be completely disrupted and that, uh, a disease was going to ravage everybody, and even though it turned out to be a terrible disease</p>
    <p class="body">It wasn't nearly as bad as what we were fearful of</p>
    <p class="body">What we were fearful of was some kind of plague that would just wipe everybody out, and that I think that initial mindset that people had was very difficult to shake</p>
    <p class="body">Even now that you know COVID this new variant, this omicron is not nearly as dangerous</p>
    <p class="body">It's much more contagious</p>
    <p class="body">But not nearly as deadly</p>
    <p class="body">There's some people that still want to treat it like it's the thing that's going to kill everybody</p>
    <p class="body">They still want to have this sort of same mindset because that's the initial mindset they have</p>
    <p class="body">So I think when people were stockpiling toilet paper and stockpiling food, there was a fear, fear, mindset, a mindset of the unknown</p>
    <p class="body">That gripped people that a lot of folks are just not</p>
    <p class="body">Willing to let go of</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, yeah, I mean I yeah</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, that's a whole</p>
    <p class="body">That's a whole thing that I don't</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I don't understand</p>
    <p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Well, you know you've experienced a lot of like real danger, and you know real life threatening situations</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But we're all at different</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You've seen people you've taken lives</p>
    <p class="body">You've seen people you know lives leave their body</p>
    <p class="body">It's a, you know, the level</p>
    <p class="body">That's the thing that I, one of the things that I truly appreciate about veterans is you don't</p>
    <p class="body">To do what they do, unless you've experienced massive amounts of diversity just getting through</p>
    <p class="body">I mean you're talking</p>
    <p class="body">If you're talking about someone who's a seal just getting through buds</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, what ******* percentage of human beings that walk around could do that very few? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Non nominated</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Very few</p>
    <p class="body">They're different humans, you know, and it's because they've overcome adversity</p>
    <p class="body">And for some people</p>
    <p class="body">Any kind of thing that throws their regular routine off track will **** them up</p>
    <p class="body">Hey Jamie, can you tell Jeff to bring in the coffee and and cups with water too with? </p>
    <p class="body">No cups for the water</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean but but don't you think that like? </p>
    <p class="body">You know the people who haven't</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, the only way you know you don't have you don't get exposed to adversity</p>
    <p class="body">Is by fear right? </p>
    <p class="body">And so again, yeah, whatever is holding you back from doing what you want to do</p>
    <p class="body">Or trying things or experiencing things, yeah</p>
    <p class="body">It's never as bad</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, obviously there are some things that are as bad, but most of the time</p>
    <p class="body">You know you've been so worried about something, and it's not really as bad as you thought it was, right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Most of the time, yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Insult, and so that's my thing is</p>
    <p class="body">It's like, why were you? </p>
    <p class="body">Why were you fearful of it? </p>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like they're like we</p>
    <p class="body">I don't think that we were born with fear</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I think we were born with like natural survivability and and instinct, right? </p>
    <p class="body">But I don't think you're you're born with</p>
    <p class="body">You're definitely not born with hate</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Right, yeah, you're definitely not born with hate</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I think some people are born</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I think unfortunately</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I'm just guessing I'm not really a psychologist, but I think unfortunately there's a certain level of fear and anxiety</p>
    <p class="body">I think kids do adapt or adopt rather from their parents</p>
    <p class="body">I think there's</p>
    <p class="body">Some of it might even be in their genes</p>
    <p class="body">You know people that are neurotic and and weirded out</p>
    <p class="body">Maybe they're modeling their parents</p>
    <p class="body">Maybe they're paying attention to how their parents handle things and they they handle</p>
    <p class="body">Things similarly for</p>
    <p class="body">Sure, or maybe it's it's passed down</p>
    <p class="body">I think there's a lot of **** that's passed down to people</p>
    <p class="body">You know, I really do</p>
    <p class="body">Just like there's a lot of positive traits that get passed down to people</p>
    <p class="body">I think there's a lot of negative ones too</p>
    <p class="body">Unfortunately, and I think</p>
    <p class="body">You know your children learn in many ways, whether it's through genes or whether they should experience</p>
    <p class="body">They learn through in many, many ways through the way</p>
    <p class="body">The parents handle stuff</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But do you think? </p>
    <p class="body">Do you think that that's in your your DNA or do you think that that's because that's how you seen it done, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like you know what I mean, like? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">We both</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, it could be both, but I also think it's like</p>
    <p class="body">You I think you need some challenges</p>
    <p class="body">You know some of my favorite people besides veterans or or, uh, jujitsu people and one of the reasons why is 'cause they experience so much adversity like, and I mean like it's it's safe</p>
    <p class="body">It's, you know, it's all controls and a controlled environment, but in that moment when someone is trying to strangle you</p>
    <p class="body">You're you're literally fighting for your life</p>
    <p class="body">It doesn't feel safe</p>
    <p class="body">It doesn't feel controlled</p>
    <p class="body">Someone got your back and that that forearm goes underneath your neck and you're like, oh **** like you won't</p>
    <p class="body">You know the reality is you're playing a game, and that game is I'm going to kill you with my bare hands and when that guy gets your back and gets your neck he just killed you</p>
    <p class="body">And then you tap and you go again</p>
    <p class="body">But even though you survive, and even though it's safe, it's a way of recreating</p>
    <p class="body">It's like a facsimile</p>
    <p class="body">You know</p>
    <p class="body">It's like a reasonable version of a life or death scenario that gets to play out all the time</p>
    <p class="body">Most of the time it's very peaceful most of the time</p>
    <p class="body">It's fun</p>
    <p class="body">You swap hands, it's all good, but there's moments in these struggles where you're out of breath and then all of a sudden this guy mounts you and you're like, oh **** like those moments, most people never experience that thing where you you have to push because you either you're going to escape or you're going to submit and</p>
    <p class="body">Having moments in your life where you really test it</p>
    <p class="body">Gets you to understand who you are, gets you to understand where your character lies, gets you, understand what, what your thresholds are, what what, your where your strengths are, where your weaknesses are lets you strengthen those weaknesses in a very real, usable way</p>
    <p class="body">I think most people they don't experience enough difficult scenarios in their life and one of the things that I love most about jiu jitsu is you could just take a regular person and you could transform them</p>
    <p class="body">And and through this difficult game that you're playing, you can change the way you interface with reality you'll</p>
    <p class="body">You'll have more character</p>
    <p class="body">You'll have more more ability to withstand difficult situations</p>
    <p class="body">They'll be more normal for you</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean yeah, I mean look you you until you've gone through it</p>
    <p class="body">I call it the lens of life</p>
    <p class="body">You know your lens gets shaped on what to focus on by what you've seen through it right and and kind of prioritizing</p>
    <p class="body">You know football was that for me</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I, I do</p>
    <p class="body">I don't</p>
    <p class="body">I don't roll enough, but like I do jujitsu</p>
    <p class="body">But like you know, football was that for me growing up was it was about getting hit and about about having to get back up right about someone stopping you</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, it was a team sport</p>
    <p class="body">It was you're relying on other people to help protect you</p>
    <p class="body">You're not going to win a football game by yourself</p>
    <p class="body">You know it was kind of like that</p>
    <p class="body">About, you know lose lose 5 yards and then have to get back up and try to get it again</p>
    <p class="body">You know that was what it was for me</p>
    <p class="body">Growing up was that was my contact sport about, you know look, you can look over and see what guys are going to are going to rock your bill right? </p>
    <p class="body">And that was kind of what it was for me</p>
    <p class="body">Look, I love jujitsu too</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, jujitsu is exactly what you're talking about</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, there's nothing more more nerve wracking than someone being on top of you and you can't</p>
    <p class="body">Breathe right, like in 'cause at that point they have control of you</p>
    <p class="body">At that point, they're deciding your fate</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, we could, you know, we could roll jiu jitsu and if they get their arm around your neck, I mean they get to decide if they let go, you know, and it's it's a real vulnerability and test of of you being there, right? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, the more experience you have in adversity and tough times and and and coming out of it and</p>
    <p class="body">In trying to figure out and I think that's the cool thing about jiu jitsu is</p>
    <p class="body">As you roll and then you try to figure out</p>
    <p class="body">OK, so obviously when you when you have to tap that was not where you wanted to</p>
    <p class="body">Be right, how did? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You get there</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">How did I get there, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like what did I do wrong, right? </p>
    <p class="body">And isn't there so much to be to be? </p>
    <p class="body">To be said about that, like what? </p>
    <p class="body">If we did that in life</p>
    <p class="body">Like check I got here I messed up but the problem is in life</p>
    <p class="body">Now we're the way the world is now</p>
    <p class="body">You can't, you can't go back like you can't say</p>
    <p class="body">Oh well, I did the best I could right there</p>
    <p class="body">I wouldn't do it again, and this is how I would fix it, because now like the world just doesn't accept it like it's almost like the ha ha gotcha, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like it's a it's a, it is just to apologize at this day and age</p>
    <p class="body">Like means you're done like it's almost like apologies or</p>
    <p class="body">It just means it's going to be brought up and held against you forever</p>
    <p class="body">It's like you just admitted</p>
    <p class="body">To what they were right about, and it's like</p>
    <p class="body">How does that make sense? </p>
    <p class="body">Like how do you get better from not messing up? </p>
    <p class="body">Like how do you get better from? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean I messed up every single day and I just apologize and I mean it</p>
    <p class="body">I mean it when I'm sorry like I don't want to hurt</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Anybody people would say at a certain point in time, if you keep apologizing for the same thing, you're just getting away with apologizing</p>
    <p class="body">You're not fixing yourself, right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But that's the difference, right, is? </p>

    <p class="body">Way more insane, but way more difficult to overcome and to learn things from</p>
    <p class="body">It's like it seems like for a lot of the combat veterans that I talked to</p>
    <p class="body">Their their experiences are kind of like burned in their brain in some way where it's not like you're I mean, sure, I'm sure they're stronger because of the adversity they've been through, but also some of it is too much</p>
    <p class="body">And it just leaves them schucking</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, you know, they used to call it Shellshock</p>
    <p class="body">Remember, I mean that's what they used to call it before it was PTSD, but troops were coming back from Vietnam</p>

        <p class="body">Goods inside of us</p>
        <p class="body">Feeling good like like those good things are inside of us and it's just our ego that keeps us from feeling and being happy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">The ibogaine gave you this understanding of</p>
        <p class="body">All the conflicts that you've caused and whether it's a interrelational with other people or even with yourself by not finishing things and not following through on things</p>
        <p class="body">Do you think that it was trying to show you that some part of your problems lie in the fact that maybe you don't respect your own efforts? </p>
        <p class="body">Like when you when you look at that you haven't finished things you think like</p>
        <p class="body">It was showing you that you don't ever respect for yourself 'cause you</p>

        <p class="body">To do right</p>
        <p class="body">And if you like the only thing that I've</p>
        <p class="body">And I still I still struggle with it, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like the only thing that I feel is like</p>
        <p class="body">Whenever I mess up, you know, like like if I just I live in this mindset of well, I can always be better so I just I</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like I stay focused on that aspect of it of like</p>
        <p class="body">What did I do wrong? </p>
        <p class="body">It's a hard thing</p>
        <p class="body">It's a hard balance</p>
        <p class="body">Because I always want to be better, I always want to be</p>
        <p class="body">I always want to be better</p>

        <p class="body">That's what matters, like you're gonna mess up like that's normal</p>
        <p class="body">And I think it was like it</p>
        <p class="body">It gave me like I don't know, maybe a little</p>

        <p class="body">And and I just</p>
        <p class="body">I think that everything that I do is about trying to</p>
        <p class="body">Help people</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like that's kind of what? </p>
        <p class="body">What I? </p>

        <p class="body">Got there and couldn't see the truck</p>

        <p class="body">The top of it was and so</p>
        <p class="body">I I swam down to try to see if the windows were unlocked or were open</p>
        <p class="body">I thought the window might be open and it wasn't, and so then I thought to myself</p>
        <p class="body">Well, where's my window punch at? </p>
        <p class="body">Well, it's in my bunker gear that's on the side of the</p>
        <p class="body">Of the of the pond, and I was so mad at myself at this time</p>
        <p class="body">My my buddy Eric and my buddy Jonathan jumped in right behind</p>
        <p class="body">Started swimming out there, no questions asked</p>
        <p class="body">I mean just 'cause they knew it was just to get down his time to time to do it and</p>
        <p class="body">They get out there and then</p>
        <p class="body">This one of the police officers threw me her baton so got it and then I couldn't bust the window open with it</p>
        <p class="body">I couldn't get enough leverage underwater and my buddy Eric</p>
        <p class="body">I mean this dude is like he's</p>
        <p class="body">Jacked right so
            <p class="body">He's just he's just beating this window and beats it</p>
            <p class="body">Beats it open</p>
            <p class="body">And he beat the back window open</p>
            <p class="body">I told him beat the back window</p>
            <p class="body">Open first was</p>
            <p class="body">A four door truck because I was afraid the guy was still</p>
            <p class="body">Conscious and I</p>
            <p class="body">I was afraid that he was going to reach out and grab me and drown me</p>
            <p class="body">So I was like if I can come in through the back window</p>
            <p class="body">He can't</p>
            <p class="body">Just meet</p>
            <p class="body">You know immediately grab me, but I couldn't get into the back window 'cause I was like the truck was full of stuff like it</p>

            <p class="body">So then he I dove down, dove in the truck</p>
            <p class="body">And the guy was in there and he was</p>
            <p class="body">He was up like he's floating</p>

            <p class="body">I I tried to, I tried to reach in and grab him or reach and grabbed him and I just kind of felt where his up at top and I grabbed his collar of his shirt 'cause I knew I could just get him out of the window which is pretty tight to fit a person through a window right? </p>
            <p class="body">So pulled him out and whenever I did I kind of like</p>
            <p class="body">Sank because like I had him with me</p>
            <p class="body">And I just knew I couldn't let him go, because if I did let him go, I'd never find him right in the pond and</p>
            <p class="body">Yeah, I thought I was going to drown</p>

                <p class="body">You know it becomes a normal thing like so that this becomes enormous, like in a relationship</p>
                <p class="body">You know nobody starts off</p>
                <p class="body">By beating each other right like</p>
                <p class="body">It starts off by saying, you know you know like **** you right and then it well that becomes normal, right? </p>
                <p class="body">And every time the bars pushed a little bit further, run it further, and the next thing you know, it's just</p>

                <p class="body">It's toxic and it's just bad, and it's like</p>
                <p class="body">You know, we just lose respect for each other and it happens</p>
                <p class="body">I mean, it's it</p>
                <p class="body">Can happen so fast if you don't</p>
                <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
                <p class="body">Pay attention you can, and that that I mean for a guy that's horrible</p>
                <p class="body">But for a woman, it's worse because a woman has to worry physically about her</p>
                <p class="body">Her safety from a guy you know that's</p>
                <p class="body">When you know you have daughters, as do I, and that's one of the scariest thoughts is that someone's gonna</p>
                **** your daughter up
            </p>
            <p class="body">Beat them up or</p>
            <p class="body">Do something terrible to him</p>
            <p class="body">It's like</p>
            <p class="body">The fact that men are capable of that is just such a horrific</p>
            <p class="body">Aspect of life, you know, 'cause most people aren't capable of that most people would never do that</p>
            <p class="body">But the people that would do that, they're real</p>
            <p class="body">They're out there</p>
            <p class="body">You know? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">And how do you prep them for it? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">I that's a good ******* question</p>
            <p class="body">How do you you know? </p>
            <p class="body">I mean, I think one way is by setting an example</p>
            <p class="body">The way you treat people, that's what they're going to expect from other people</p>
            <p class="body">You know the way you treat your wife the way you treat your</p>
            <p class="body">You know the people that are around you</p>
            <p class="body">They're going to expect that</p>
            'cause, that's what?
        </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know if you're hanging out with custom, if you're hanging out with ****** people and they</p>
        <p class="body">See you doing that</p>
        <p class="body">They're gonna hang out with ****** people, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, and and that's why I go back to my circle, right? </p>
        <p class="body">My circle is</p>
        <p class="body">It's it's literally everything and</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like with my daughters look, I'm</p>
        <p class="body">I'll be the longest person they'll ever date</p>
        <p class="body">I'll be the longest man they'll date and how I treat them</p>
        <p class="body">Is what they're gonna think</p>
        <p class="body">Is is like they're gonna measure everybody to me</p>
        <p class="body">And so if they start dating ****** guys down the road, I should probably look in the mirror</p>
        <p class="body">My example that I said to them is and not just</p>
        <p class="body">Not just that I'm, you know, I'm good to my daughters and that I'm respectful to women</p>
        <p class="body">But then I I work hard and that I I I serve the community, and that I I continue to try to better myself and and I accept responsibility for for my actions and</p>
        <p class="body">All these things, like they're watching everything and that is it</p>
        <p class="body">It's going to program them to someday</p>
        <p class="body">Like you know, we automatically as as parents</p>
        <p class="body">We automatically have whatever you want to call it, like streetcred with their children, and that's how they learn too</p>
        <p class="body">To handle problems, and that's how they handle you</p>
        <p class="body">Know relationships and things like that</p>
        <p class="body">And it's just so important that you know my daughters are my accountability factor</p>
        <p class="body">Like I look at it and it's like I try to treat people the way that I would want someone to treat my daughters</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Now when you talk about that, I began experience about how it bothered you, that you know you had to think</p>
        <p class="body">About all these times we disappointed people or all the people that were upset at you</p>
        <p class="body">What about that was what was so frustrating about that? </p>
        <p class="body">Was it that you had already gotten through that and put it aside and now it's like rehashing it and just making you feel like **** Or was it just that you were confronted with reality? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I think</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">I mean, you didn't like it</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I think it's just like</p>
        <p class="body">There's just some people that</p>
        <p class="body">I mean you're not going to</p>
        <p class="body">You're never going to be</p>
        <p class="body">Good enough for right? </p>
        <p class="body">You know, and and it doesn't</p>
        <p class="body">It's not necessarily you it, I mean</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Sometimes it does</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I mean, well, I mean yeah</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Sometimes it's just them, yeah</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But again again, sometimes it's just them, right? </p>
        <p class="body">And but I didn't see the people</p>
        <p class="body">I didn't see the people</p>
        <p class="body">Not the people I ****** over</p>
        <p class="body">I didn't see them</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I've seen like</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I mean I, I seen people like family members that that</p>
        <p class="body">You're like, well, you know why? </p>
        <p class="body">Why was it like this for me, right? </p>
        <p class="body">You know? </p>
        <p class="body">That was</p>
        <p class="body">You know that that was an aspect of</p>
        <p class="body">Look, I just let it go like you know, that's kind of what that's all the stuff I seen with Ibogaine was kind of like just let it go</p>
        <p class="body">Just let it go right</p>
        <p class="body">It wasn't it wasn't</p>
        <p class="body">I didn't see the things that like I didn't see anything about combat</p>
        <p class="body">I didn't see you know, I didn't see anything like that</p>
        <p class="body">I just seen the things that I let control me that I couldn't control</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So as I began, just like the way I've heard it described, is that it's ruthlessly introspective</p>
        <p class="body">It's like it</p>
        <p class="body">Makes you see things that maybe you've been avoiding thinking about</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean look, we all know if we all sit down and we truly want to see it</p>
        <p class="body">We all kind of know</p>
        <p class="body">Why we are the way we are</p>
        <p class="body">Everything adds up, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like it's just like we don't want to</p>
        <p class="body">We don't want to face it</p>
        <p class="body">And I began makes you face it like you're going to sit there</p>
        <p class="body">And it's going to keep you there until you've seen enough of</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">It you know, are you hallucinating? </p>
        <p class="body">Why are you doing? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">This I mean I</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, it is like I'm really there, but I mean I can open my eyes</p>
        <p class="body">And stand up if I mean the world spinning, but</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">But when you close your eyes, it's like you're there, so it's like you're rehashing memories or like</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">Oh yeah, you did</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Right? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Is that what it is? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, it's it's</p>
        <p class="body">It's really like</p>
        <p class="body">I liked it because</p>
        <p class="body">The people that I seen like</p>
        <p class="body">Obviously I wasn't walking through a city, but the people that I seen were real the the, the moments that I was watching myself like how I talked to people like there was a piece of that right like</p>
        <p class="body">Were was real moments</p>
        <p class="body">It was like I was sitting in a stadium</p>
        <p class="body">Watching myself from a like a a different point of view</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, and</p>
        <p class="body">Does that make sense? </p>
        <p class="body">It was real</p>
        <p class="body">It was real, like it wasn't like I was seeing like crazy</p>
        <p class="body">Crazy, you know</p>
        <p class="body">Alternate reality</p>
        <p class="body">It was real is real people</p>
        <p class="body">It was real situations it was</p>
        <p class="body">Real things</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Now was it a replica of what you'd experienced, or was it? </p>
        <p class="body">Not so was it situations that never really occurred</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Well, I mean obviously they're walking to to onto the stage</p>
        <p class="body">Well, I was not, you know, obviously all these people weren't in one room, but but their faces were real</p>
        <p class="body">They were real people in my life</p>
        <p class="body">They were there</p>
        <p class="body">They were real people</p>
        <p class="body">So I mean obviously there was like a balance to it</p>
        <p class="body">But it was like all of it made sense if</p>
        <p class="body">That makes sense, like every bit of it like I knew what it was telling me</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So it's like you walked onto a stage and then the audience was all filled with people that you've had conflicts with</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Or just like people that I don't feel like you know, people, I feel like I've that</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">You let down or</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">That I, you know that that make me feel like I let</p>
        <p class="body">Them down when when I don't think I when in in in and when I look at it logically I I didn't you know I mean like</p>
        <p class="body">And there was just, you know, there was a lot of</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">That and so you get out of that you do DMT</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah the next day</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">You put it all together because of those two experiences</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">When I come</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">And then what is life like right after that? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know, before but so before I went down there</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I was having an anxiety</p>
        <p class="body">Attack a week</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Like what does what? </p>
        <p class="body">What happens during your anxiety attacks? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know, like I'll wake up throwing up like I'd be in the floor like throwing up crying</p>
        <p class="body">Just like can't control it</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">And it's but when you say anxiety, like what are you thinking? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know I, I just did how much of a failure I am</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">That's what it was, yeah failure</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean, that's probably</p>
        <p class="body">And look, I'm not gonna say those thoughts go away</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like while I'm on that truck</p>
        <p class="body">I was on that truck the other day</p>
        <p class="body">All I was telling myself was just like</p>
        <p class="body">You know I could just I can remember it vividly have</p>
        <p class="body">You're a ***** ** **** Look at this</p>
        <p class="body">This is you like you, you didn't bring the window punch with you</p>
        <p class="body">How could you mess up so bad now? </p>
        <p class="body">This guy is going to die because of you and then I'm watching my friends from out there and I'm just thinking to myself like oh, look at you, you're an idiot and now you've brought them in here and now they're gonna drown and you're gonna you're gonna get your friends killed and then you know I mean like it was just like the whole time I'm literally like my brain</p>
        <p class="body">He's just talking **** to me of like</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, you know what? </p>
        <p class="body">Like you're you're not going to</p>
        <p class="body">You're not going to be able to get this guy out now because you didn't train hard enough, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like it's</p>
        <p class="body">Just like all these</p>
        <p class="body">Things like just just just beating it right? </p>
        <p class="body">And I don't know why it works that way right? </p>
        <p class="body">But it it works for me</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">When you when? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">A lot too though</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">You were growing up</p>
        <p class="body">Did you have parents that were very critical of you? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know, I mean like there was accountability</p>
        <p class="body">Everything was black and white, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like everything was accountability, right? </p>
        <p class="body">You know, I mean look my dad, my grandpa</p>
        <p class="body">I mean I I grew up with my mom until I was like 10</p>
        <p class="body">And then I I went over to my dad and you know my dad, my dad is one of my dad and my grandfather and my grandmother like they're just</p>
        <p class="body">The greatest people I've ever met, and I if I can be half of them, I'll be somebody</p>
        <p class="body">But it was just</p>
        <p class="body">Like it was more of a</p>
        <p class="body">There's right and wrong, there's you</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Know, but was there? </p>
        <p class="body">A thing back then about you not being good enough</p>
        <p class="body">Oh, nothing</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">No, no never</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So why do you have that thought in your head now? </p>
        <p class="body">Do you think like why? </p>
        <p class="body">Why do you? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Because I couldn't say my team</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So is that when it started, yeah</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean</p>
        <p class="body">You know, and then the metal</p>
        <p class="body">Just made it worse</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">And for people who don't know what you're talking about, we had a long conversation about this on the the first podcast that we did together, and it's</p>
        <p class="body">Harrowing story, I mean it's wild **** what you went through</p>
        <p class="body">And I would just tell people this</p>
        <p class="body">Go listen to that</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, so you have to say it again</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, but that that's where it comes from, you know, like</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know like I when I walked in that valley that day like I truly thought that I was</p>
        <p class="body">I thought I was</p>
        <p class="body">Good at something, right? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I put the work in and like I, I thought I was good and and you know I</p>
        <p class="body">I really thought it</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, obviously it shows my naiveness but I just I never thought that there would be a situation that I couldn't get my teammates out of right</p>
        <p class="body">And I thought that if anybody was ever gonna get killed, it was going to be me</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, just like</p>
        <p class="body">Just like wanting to wanting to help them and and and bring them home alive so bad and then just</p>
        <p class="body">Getting in there and and they're all like they're all dead</p>
        <p class="body">And so it was just like</p>
        <p class="body">I just feel like I let him down, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like I, I just feel like I let him down, you know</p>
        <p class="body">And so</p>
        <p class="body">And then you come back home</p>
        <p class="body">And and</p>
        <p class="body">Then you get this Medal of Honor</p>
        <p class="body">So like it's just it's such a</p>
        <p class="body">It's such a mental, you know</p>

        <p class="body">I'm not saying either one of those evil, so let me say that back but for</p>
        <p class="body">Me in my mindset like</p>
        <p class="body">For me to be able to to</p>

        <p class="body">What level are you willing to get at and? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">The crazy thing to me has always been that then you ask those people to just rejoin society</p>
        <p class="body">And I don't know how much like again, I don't know how much counseling they give you or how much counseling would you</p>
        <p class="body">Know how much do? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">They give you and then balls</p>
        <p class="body">In the military, when you when you're leaving</p>
        <p class="body">I mean</p>
        <p class="body">So I was fortunate because I got sent home from Afghanistan</p>
        <p class="body">I went to, uh</p>
        <p class="body">To this rehab Center for like 8 weeks</p>
        <p class="body">It didn't make any sense to me at the time because I think it was too close to the event</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">What is the the rehab center? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Like it was, uh, cognitive CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
        <p class="body">I think so</p>
        <p class="body">Basically like where you try to re</p>
        <p class="body">Reprogram the way you think about things</p>
        <p class="body">Or like OK so I you know I</p>
        <p class="body">Feel like I was a failure and then you you write it out</p>
        <p class="body">I mean it was like this therapy that</p>
        <p class="body">It was tough, right and dumb</p>
        <p class="body">I so I went to that, but that was like I had this amazing and I I talked about her in the book, Captain Katie Cop</p>
        <p class="body">She was a</p>
        <p class="body">She was on the Combat Stress team and So what? </p>
        <p class="body">When when I was in Afghanistan, when there was a critical incident like this, they would fly in these</p>
        <p class="body">And they would like they would try to get on top of it pretty quick, right? </p>
        <p class="body">To be there to help and and all this</p>
        <p class="body">She did</p>
        <p class="body">She did so amazing</p>
        <p class="body">I didn't want to talk to her while I was there</p>
        <p class="body">So she ended up sending me home from Afghanistan</p>
        <p class="body">In December</p>
        <p class="body">In November for I got home December 5th</p>
        <p class="body">But she like worked out this arrangement to where I could instead of just going back to base, I came straight home 'cause the deployment was still going on and I went to the CBT thing</p>
        <p class="body">But I mean you're not really taught about counseling</p>
        <p class="body">You're not really like</p>
        <p class="body">You know you're just not</p>
        <p class="body">It's in the last thing you want to do is</p>
        <p class="body">Is like feel like you're weak, right, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like feel like you can't handle it</p>
        'cause it's your job
    </p>
    <p class="body">You know it's like it's like this seining like</p>
    <p class="body">You know nobody? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean I</p>
    <p class="body">I wouldn't say anybody judges you because look, we're all we're all suffering and we want people to get help</p>
    <p class="body">But just like one of these deals like you know, you don't want to, you don't wanna be like, Oh yeah, that bothers</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Me yeah yeah the the problem with the strong people, right? </p>
    <p class="body">They don't want to ask for help</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And I just don't want being inconvenienced</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Right, that's another thing with strong people, so</p>
    <p class="body">This shift that happened after you do the ibogaine and then you do the DMT like what's before and what's after</p>
    <p class="body">Like what? </p>
    <p class="body">What is the difference afterwards? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">You know afterward</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I didn't even I didn't have anxiety</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">So no more anxiety attacks, that's still the same way</p>
    <p class="body">How long ago was this? </p>

    <p class="body">How awesome is this right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like I can literally look at at my friends and just</p>
    <p class="body">You know, I mean, I'll start tearing up just thinking about like how, how awesome it is that I get to be surrounded by such great people</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I mean, I'm sitting here with you right now</p>

    <p class="body">But who does deserve it then if you don't? </p>

    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Course you deserve it</p>
    <p class="body">Well, I mean, I don't think anybody deserves anything</p>
    <p class="body">I think we're worthy of things</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yes, but but it's also like that thought like you don't deserve</p>
    <p class="body">It means it shouldn't be</p>
    <p class="body">Happening to you</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, it's not</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's not just simply you don't deserve it</p>
    <p class="body">It's you don't deserve it, so it shouldn't be happening</p>
    <p class="body">But like what does that mean? </p>

    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">It is</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I think sometimes people complicate their thought process with unnecessary paths</p>
    <p class="body">They just go down these like thing you're not gonna get anything out of that you know the why do I deserve this path there's there's nothing there</p>
    <p class="body">For you but</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But that's a natural path, yes</p>
    <p class="body">So that but, and that's what I'm saying is is, that's a natural path that automatically comes in</p>
    <p class="body">And instead of, well, riding that path that we know, there's no logic to or good into</p>
    <p class="body">It's like I get to do this</p>
    <p class="body">How ******

        <p class="body">Look at it and so like yeah, that's the control we have</p>
        <p class="body">We don't have control of what happens to us most of the time</p>
        <p class="body">Right, but we</p>
        <p class="body">Do have a control on how we look</p>

            <p class="body">It's a choice on which side you you choose to pick, right like? </p>

            <p class="body">You know, like you want to mess with my family, you want to mess with people I care about</p>
            <p class="body">It's a whole different ball game</p>

            <p class="body">Trying to be able to see it from somebody elses side is a huge huge tool trying to see</p>
            <p class="body">Trying to see somebody else from their view</p>
            <p class="body">Is is a really really critical tool? </p>
            <p class="body">Before we get all wrapped up in</p>
            <p class="body">How we're going to handle? </p>
            <p class="body">Things, yeah, that's a</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Thing that very few people do is try to look at life through this person, especially if you're you have a conflict with a person not like</p>
            <p class="body">A you know hand to hand combat situation fighting for your life</p>
            <p class="body">But I mean any kind of conflict that people have</p>
            <p class="body">It's hard sometimes for people to look at other human beings</p>
            <p class="body">And try to imagine what's going on in their head and how they view you and how they view whatever conflict you're 2 engaged in</p>
            <p class="body">The two of you are engaged in like it's</p>
            <p class="body">It's a good exercise</p>
            <p class="body">And it's also it's good</p>
            <p class="body">It's good for empathy</p>
            <p class="body">It's good to kind of get a sense of</p>
            <p class="body">You know how you should communicate with that person? </p>
            <p class="body">Think about what it's like to be them</p>
            <p class="body">Try to put yourself in that position</p>
            <p class="body">And for a lot of people, that's very hard to do</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">Yeah, yeah, because</p>
            <p class="body">When you do that, you have to also check yourself in that</p>
            <p class="body">You know, I I feel like for me like I try to go into things of like look I'm going to I'm going to lay it all on the table for you</p>
            <p class="body">I never want to miss an opportunity for the fact that I'm afraid that I'm going to get screwed over</p>
            <p class="body">I'm going to get hurt</p>
            <p class="body">I don't want to miss on getting to know somebody or getting getting having a ****** relationship or being able to to meet somebody or then be my friend</p>
            <p class="body">I don't</p>
            <p class="body">I'm not ever going to let the fear of what they might do to me or how it might affect me</p>
            <p class="body">Keep me from doing that</p>
            'cause I know that I can recover
        </p>
        <p class="body">You know, like I I I</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">Right? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I don't know like I I just people are great like there's most people are good</p>
        <p class="body">I I believe most people are good</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Most people are good, especially if you get them in on the right day and under the right circumstances, and you interact with them the right way</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But even if you catch him on the wrong day, like how much of an influence could you have on him right by being the person that comes up and says, hey, I</p>
        <p class="body">You know how's your day right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like like just anything just a little bit of empathy goes a long ways</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, no definitely does</p>
        <p class="body">So when you wrote this book so you wrote it with this guy Robert O'Neill</p>
        <p class="body">Who is this gentleman? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">So Rob killed bin Laden</p>
        <p class="body">Oh, and uh</p>
        <p class="body">You know he what brought us together with the main story and he can tell this</p>
        <p class="body">I talked about killing that guy</p>
        <p class="body">We speak together</p>
        <p class="body">And Rob talked about how</p>
        <p class="body">You know, right after he shot bin Laden</p>
        <p class="body">Immediately you know, went over to</p>
        <p class="body">Bin Laden's kids</p>
        <p class="body">And he was like</p>
        <p class="body">I just took out the guy who seems the most evil to us</p>
        <p class="body">And now I just became the most evil person to them</p>
        <p class="body">It's not, it ain't simple</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Right? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">It's not simple</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Taking a man's life in front of his family cannot be simple, no? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">No, I mean yeah, so you know that was kind of what brought us together and we're just like how can we help people? </p>
        <p class="body">How can we? </p>
        <p class="body">How can we show our stories? </p>
        <p class="body">You know 'cause 'cause I feel like these books like you talk about into the fire you, you know I'll talk about my book</p>
        <p class="body">I feel like it made us like not human like larger than life I'm I'm</p>
        <p class="body">No different than you</p>
        <p class="body">What do you? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Mean by that? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Just like it, it tells a story in a way that people are like I could never imagine doing that</p>
        <p class="body">You know, like I could never, well gosh, I I</p>
        <p class="body">I would never be able to do that</p>
        <p class="body">I could never imagine being there or doing that, right? </p>
        <p class="body">And it's like</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, well, I mean I</p>
        <p class="body">Couldn't have either before I was there</p>
        <p class="body">And so I just felt like</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I'm I'm no different than anybody else, you know, I just I was there, you know, I, I went over, I was there</p>
        <p class="body">Does everybody makes different choices in life and? </p>
        <p class="body">How could we take our experiences and and try to help people see if there's a way forward? </p>
        <p class="body">There's hope that that that people are good that you know the take from the hard lessons of that's held us back or or that that we've had to be in and try to turn that into</p>
        <p class="body">Something good</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">And so when you set out to write this book, did you? </p>
        <p class="body">Get in touch with Robert</p>
        <p class="body">Did you guys? </p>
        <p class="body">Did you both have like the same kind of vision as to what? </p>
        <p class="body">To do here</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean we yeah</p>
        <p class="body">I mean we we just we wanted to have principles that are simple and and we wanted to</p>
        <p class="body">Come together and talk more like not just about war but about everyday life</p>
        <p class="body">Everyday struggles that we have and kind of humanize</p>
        <p class="body">You know, uh, humanize</p>
        <p class="body">Humanized war right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like not humanized war, but humanized life, and humanize us</p>
        <p class="body">And and and kind of show that look the same concepts that made us successful in combat or the same it's it's, it is literally the same principles</p>
        <p class="body">That you just apply in all situations</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So do you feel like the first book when you're talking about it being larger than life that would? </p>
        <p class="body">That you're</p>
        <p class="body">Missing, like your own internal</p>
        <p class="body">Struggles and dialogues like what is it about it that didn't make you seem like a regular person to people? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I mean, I think it only told like the majority of the good side</p>
        <p class="body">Like it didn't</p>
        <p class="body">You know it didn't tell</p>
        <p class="body">You know that</p>
        <p class="body">The aspect of you know look, I grew up in a small town like I, you know</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I I you know I'm I'm adopted like you know I mean like there's all these factors of growing up</p>
        <p class="body">But like the people who kind of</p>
        <p class="body">Shaped me to</p>
        <p class="body">Do that like how did I get? </p>
        <p class="body">To the point that that you know that I did what I did in that valley in that moment, well, it's all these people around me</p>
        <p class="body">You know what I mean and still today, like everything I'm successful at is because I'm surrounded by great people who push me and hold me accountable every day</p>
        <p class="body">And you know, this book talks about, you know we're not meant to be alone</p>
        <p class="body">You know, we're we're meant to to live be around people and interact with people</p>
        <p class="body">And you know this book kind of talks about how</p>
        <p class="body">You know how? </p>
        <p class="body">People are everything and and you know who you select to be around from all the way from who you select to be around from who you all</p>
        <p class="body">That is what there's always a way forward</p>
        <p class="body">There's always a way forward, and when you can find hope, it doesn't matter if you're in a valley in Afghanistan surrounded and you've just lost all your team or you're back here and you're getting divorced or or whatever it is, as long as there's hope and you've got good people around you, you're going to get</p>
        <p class="body">Through it, like everybody has a bad day</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">And so when you decided to do this, how do you start a book like this like like? </p>
        <p class="body">What is the what are the first words you write? </p>
        <p class="body">Are you writing this with a A ghostwriter or you are ghostwriter? </p>
        <p class="body">So do you just sit? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I can't spell my name</p>
        <p class="body">Didn't mean</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So, but well, that's why you you know when you type it gives you that little red squiggly line underneath</p>
        <p class="body">It lets you know he's he spelled it wrong</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">It's handy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So how do you start something like this, like? </p>
        <p class="body">Did you have an outline in your head of? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">With an idea</p>
        <p class="body">How to do it? </p>
        <p class="body">So we came up</p>
        <p class="body">And we just kind of talked about, you know? </p>
        <p class="body">We want to like almost like a self help book</p>
        <p class="body">We wanted people to be able to read it and apply it to their lives</p>
        <p class="body">Take the stories that we have and so we come</p>
        <p class="body">We just got with, you know, people, agents</p>
        <p class="body">Who helped us put that kind of like write out this outline and then we took it around to the publishers right? </p>
        <p class="body">And the biggest thing you know me and Rob wanted with these publishers was</p>
        <p class="body">Like we didn't just want a book, we</p>
        <p class="body">Wanted a book that was</p>
        <p class="body">Like we didn't want it to be left or right, we didn't want to be political</p>
        <p class="body">We didn't want it to be</p>
        <p class="body">We want it to just be for that</p>
        <p class="body">Anybody could pick up and read</p>
        <p class="body">And apply it to their life</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Even left or right, like what percentage of people that are in the military? </p>
        <p class="body">Are left wing</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I don't</p>
        <p class="body">It was never a conversation never never</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So it's your concern is about staying alive</p>
        <p class="body">Keeping your your people alive and whatever the mission, whatever task you have to</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Do you know when I went to fight? </p>
        <p class="body">I wasn't I wasn't willing to die or fight</p>
        <p class="body">I wasn't fighting for Republicans</p>

        <p class="body">None of that matters to me like I</p>
        <p class="body">I feel like</p>
        <p class="body">The America I was fighting for</p>
        <p class="body">Was good</p>

        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Of that, of course not</p>
        <p class="body">But what I'm saying is how many people did you guys you never had conversations about politics or anything</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Anything I never I can't ever remember one</p>

        <p class="body">It never came up</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">That's interesting now</p>

        <p class="body">Afghanistan was</p>
        <p class="body">A big part of your life experiences, yeah? </p>

        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I mean it sucked, right like? </p>
        <p class="body">But it's not like there's nobody who set foot over there that I ever thought it was going to go</p>
        <p class="body">Any other way? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Really, I didn't</p>
        <p class="body">He thought, like when we pull out, it did the Taliban is just going to take over and it's</p>
        <p class="body">Going to be chaos again</p>
        <p class="body">I mean what? </p>

        <p class="body">I mean like</p>
        <p class="body">I knew we knew</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I don't know</p>
        <p class="body">Let me say this, I'll speak for me, not everybody else</p>

        <p class="body">Was that like? </p>
        <p class="body">Just hearing it because a lot of people felt the same way that you're expressing yourself right now</p>
        <p class="body">A lot of people felt that way that there's no way they were going to be able to make that</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Any chance so? </p>

        <p class="body">That's a good point</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know what we would do? </p>
        <p class="body">And again, I don't know what to believe</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know</p>
        <p class="body">Look First off Putin's evil like no way is arguing it</p>
        <p class="body">You know Ukraine? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean their their government is not known for being honest abes</p>
        <p class="body">They're one of the most corrupt governments there are</p>
        <p class="body">And it's like</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I I just</p>
        <p class="body">It just doesn't like we're hypocritical</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Again, let's see what you're saying</p>
        <p class="body">Like you're not saying that you know Russia is good and</p>
        <p class="body">Ukraine is evil</p>
        <p class="body">You're saying it's messy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I'm just saying that</p>
        <p class="body">If we were Putin</p>
        <p class="body">Obviously, the way he's handling it</p>
        <p class="body">But again, like we don't even know that how many civilians are being killed, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like and I think</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">I think the the the death count right now is in the three hundreds and so more than 300 people have died, right? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">And so I mean, why do they still have Wi-Fi Internet? </p>
        <p class="body">Why are their lights still? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">On well, that's a good question, but I think one of the things that's going on with Wi-Fi is, I think</p>
        <p class="body">My lines for sure chipped into using satellites</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But again</p>
        <p class="body">I mean it again, I don't know what's going on</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know what to believe</p>
        <p class="body">You know you you hear these these stories that inspire you to think that oh, you know, you know these people on this island on that island</p>
        <p class="body">Next thing like that, you know they gave their life and there's this and it's like, well now they're alive supposedly</p>
        <p class="body">Who knows what's what's really happening? </p>
        <p class="body">You see that</p>
        <p class="body">That tank that you know just veered off and ran over that car and it's like then you hear that that was a Ukrainian tank</p>
        <p class="body">You know what I? </p>
        <p class="body">Mean it's like you</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">I think that's not true, though I think that was there was a Russian tank, right? </p>
        <p class="body">I heard there's this, but I see what you're saying</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">I haven't any</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But there's so much misinformation online</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">There's so much misinformation online when it comes to, yeah, the island was a big one that they they told Russia to go **** himself and that they killed everybody on the island</p>
        <p class="body">But it turns out, no, they actually been</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Captured and so it's like</p>
        <p class="body">I think they're both ******** right? </p>
        <p class="body">And so it's like, you know, I don't know</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know what to do with it</p>
        <p class="body">I just my part is is like there's and at the end of the day Russia Russia is killing innocents like innocent civilians who have nothing to do with this are losing their lives</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Jamie, I'm gonna send you something just so that you could have this too</p>
        <p class="body">There is a</p>
        <p class="body">There's a very good</p>
        <p class="body">A video that's online that explains the conflict</p>
        <p class="body">You know it's it's not a judgmental video</p>
        <p class="body">It doesn't</p>
        <p class="body">It's not casting the blame one way or another, but it's a a YouTube video that explains and I I think we talked about it a little bit yesterday, but it explains how this conflict got started and why Russia for like logistic reasons</p>
        <p class="body">Why it wants to control? </p>
        <p class="body">I just sent it</p>
        <p class="body">To you buddy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But we're going to put all these sanctions on him, right? </p>
        <p class="body">But why are we still buying oil from? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Him, yeah, that's the thing</p>
        <p class="body">Like everybody is pouring Russian vodka down the toilet, but</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But we're still buying over half a million barrels a day from him</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">That is so wild</p>
        <p class="body">Right, like if you if you told that to people they would go what? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I mean</p>
        <p class="body">And and when you add that up</p>
        <p class="body">You know, I mean Putin's making. I mean, he's he's</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">So this is the video and it's</p>
        <p class="body">It's long, yeah, it's just play a little bit of it at the beginning because</p>
        <p class="body">It shows you the map of where Crimea is in Ukraine and</p>
        <p class="body">That if they join NATO like they're trying to join the EU right now, yeah if they join NATO years</p>
        <p class="body">Modern conflict series that explains the entire course of the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia, as well as the entire war</p>
        <p class="body">It's called why Russia is invading Ukraine</p>
        <p class="body">You could why Russia is invading Ukraine</p>
        <p class="body">It's available on YouTube and it's it's very good</p>
        <p class="body">Well, we don't have</p>
        <p class="body">To listen to it essentially</p>
        <p class="body">But a deal for less than</p>
        <p class="body">Within 50 it's OK</p>
        <p class="body">Essentially it shows the geographics of the area it shows you on a map like why it's important to control that area and then they also talk about how Ukraine has massive reserves of oil and natural gas and how much value there is in that</p>
        <p class="body">For for Russia</p>
        <p class="body">And for the rest of the world, and how? </p>
        <p class="body">Through this
            <p class="body">You know this</p>
            <p class="body">Sort of</p>
            <p class="body">Natural resource rich country</p>
            <p class="body">They they could become like a a huge economic power and sort of separate from from Russia and separate from</p>
            <p class="body">The rest of you know that area and become a part of the EU, which is where they're trying to do and also become a part of NATO and someone could park missiles right there</p>
            <p class="body">Sort of like what happened with the Soviet missile crisis that during the Cuban missile crisis, during Kennedy's administration, where they tried to park nuclear missiles in Cuba, which is just right off our shores</p>
            <p class="body">Like I think that's what they're trying to explain this, but again, this video goes way into depth and they're real clear about how complicated it is is a very</p>
            <p class="body">It's a very complicated situation</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">Yeah, I mean</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">There's a lot of money involved</p>
            <p class="body">There's a lot of control with the area</p>
            <p class="body">There's a lot of in terms of like tactical control, the ability to like for for military to to have control</p>
            <p class="body">In case there's some sort of an invasion or something</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">Yeah, yeah, I mean it's</p>
            <p class="body">Yeah, I mean I look</p>
            <p class="body">All I know is is that that</p>
            <p class="body">You know, there's again, there's innocent civilians getting killed, and at the end of the day, like look</p>
            <p class="body">Even if Putin you know they keep making it up</p>
            <p class="body">Well, if he gets into Kiev right, he gets into the city like you know they then they take over the city</p>
            <p class="body">Well, let me tell you something</p>
            <p class="body">They take it from us, take it from us that even when you take over that city now you're going to fight 20 years of guerrilla warfare</p>
            <p class="body">You know, you know what I mean, like what again, what is? </p>
            <p class="body">What what's the purpose here? </p>
            <p class="body">What's what are you going? </p>
            <p class="body">To gain right, what are you going? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">To gain what are you? </p>
            <p class="body">Going to gain well</p>
            <p class="body">I mean, I think what he's looking for is</p>
            <p class="body">Ukraine to give in to his demands</p>
            <p class="body">Right? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">Think he? </p>
            <p class="body">I think maybe he thought that would in the beginning, but at this point he should probably see that that's not</p>
            <p class="body">I mean, I think we it's not going to happen</p>
            <p class="body">I mean the difference in like obviously we handled it different, but the difference in us going in Iraq and Afghanistan versus him going here is like he also has the world against him, not only Ukraine</p>
            <p class="body">You know the world is is is is against him doing this, which</p>
            <p class="body">You know? </p>
            <p class="body">Yeah, I don't</p>
            <p class="body">I don't know, I don't understand it</p>
            <p class="body">I don't get it and I again I just know that it just sucks because because of political politics again</p>
            <p class="body">People are suffering, yeah</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">It is, it does suck and it is horrible</p>
            <p class="body">And it's also</p>
            <p class="body">It speaks to the distrust that people have in the mainstream media today because</p>
            <p class="body">So many people don't know what you know</p>
            <p class="body">What is the true story like? </p>
            <p class="body">What is, what am I supposed to believe? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">How do you trust them? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Right? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">How do you trust them? </p>
            <p class="body">Because even if they let's say, even if they only show</p>
            <p class="body">A part of the story that is real</p>
            <p class="body">It's lying is if you</p>
            <p class="body">Don't tell the whole story</p>
            <p class="body">It's the same as lying</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Yes, it is the same as lying</p>
            <p class="body">If you tell a distorted version of the story, because that's what the people that are paying for your advertisements want you to tell</p>
            <p class="body">That's lying</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">It's lying and and</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">This and that, and they're in the business of lying sometimes</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">Because there's again, yeah, so there's no accountability there's there's no accountability</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Sometimes they're like</p>
            <p class="body">Right? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">How do you hold them accountable? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Well, they're being held accountable by the people that pay for their ads</p>
            <p class="body">That's what's different</p>
            <p class="body">It's not like</p>
            <p class="body">You know it should be do no harm, right? </p>
            <p class="body">Just like a doctor like doctors have an oath, they're supposed to be trying to take care of someone and do no harm</p>
            <p class="body">The same should be what the the media should be</p>
            <p class="body">Their their ethos should be tell the truth always like give the facts, tell the truth and then</p>
            <p class="body">You know, in some of these shows, now, unfortunately it becomes more about editorializing than it does, even about the facts of the news</p>
            <p class="body">It becomes more about the opinions of these people and you know, we know they're reading off a ******* teleprompter</p>
            <p class="body">We know that they they have scripts</p>
            <p class="body">We know that someone talks to them about talking points</p>
            <p class="body">We know that they have</p>
            <p class="body">A corporation behind them that's paying for these ads brought to you by Pfizer, and they have all these</p>
            <p class="body">You know, people that are in their ear, and so the version, even of their editorializing is all been shaped by influence</p>
            <p class="body">Yeah, I mean this is what this is, what we're using to try to figure out what's going on in the world during this</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">Tragedy, they're they're being held like their accountability is too</p>
            <p class="body">The people that are paying them and not to the the people who are relying on them and and</p>
            <p class="body">But I mean again, look, there's only one color that matters in this country and that screen, and in this world and</p>
            <p class="body">That screen, yeah? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Yeah, it's</p>
            <p class="body">It's ******** and what people are really terrified is if, while this is happening, what happens if China invades Taiwan at the same time? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">I mean, I think that that's going to be</p>
            <p class="body">I think that that's inevitable</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Thanks so</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">I do, I mean I mean listen for whatever it's worth, right? But I mean I, I mean, of course like why? Why, if you were America's enemies right now</p>

            <p class="body">Our priorities</p>
            <p class="body">Are so far off</p>
            <p class="body">You know, we're we're worried about trying to make our naval fleet green</p>

            <p class="body">I mean, I get there's a balance but but again, like</p>
            <p class="body">You can't</p>
            <p class="body">You can't stay the free world and stay the leader and stay an influencer if you can't protect it</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">What do you think happened and in terms of like the this crazy woke **** that's invaded the military</p>
            <p class="body">I never thought I would see it in the military</p>
            <p class="body">I thought that would be the one sector of our society that would be</p>
            <p class="body">Immune to that kind of ridiculous ideology</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">I mean, I just think that people</p>
            <p class="body">You know people have gotten, so they get offended by everything and</p>
            <p class="body">I don't know like I</p>

            <p class="body">Here are ultimate first world problems and you know like but again, you have to understand like</p>
            <p class="body">Like talk about my generation</p>
            <p class="body">You know my generation, we we had access to Internet, right? </p>
            <p class="body">Like like everything was kind of instant gratification</p>
            <p class="body">I didn't have to go out and raise a garden and I didn't have to do the things that my grandparents had to do to to be able to live and to be able if everything is convenient for me</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Right? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">But but it doesn't mean that like so these people who are are portraying these problems</p>
            <p class="body">They they are true problems to them and they are that big of a deal with them but but it's kind of like when you're looking at your kids</p>
            <p class="body">Like when my daughter comes to me and she's like you know so and so</p>
            <p class="body">He said this and it hurt my feelings and</p>
            <p class="body">She's devastated</p>
            <p class="body">It goes back to adversity</p>
            <p class="body">That is the biggest problem she's ever dealt with, and it is that big to her right? </p>
            <p class="body">Just 'cause it's not to me because I've dealt with all this other</p>
            <p class="body">It is that big to her and that's what's happening with everybody else</p>
            <p class="body">Is like we have first world problems here and they haven't had adversity and they haven't had to have that and so</p>
            <p class="body">These things come up and instead of learning how to deal with them, we're trying to cater to them right instead of</p>
            <p class="body">You know when people get offended by what I say I, I always ask</p>
            <p class="body">Was it is it inaccurate? </p>
            <p class="body">It was it offensive? </p>
            <p class="body">Or was it that you just didn't like what I said? </p>
            <p class="body">Did you just not agree with me 'cause it just 'cause you don't agree with me doesn't mean I'm wrong? </p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Some people get offended too easily and that's they don't want to hear that</p>
            <p class="body">But some some people get upset at things too easily, and it's because they're making a problem that a lot of folks would think is not a very big problem, and they're turning it into a gigantic one in</p>
            <p class="body">Their head because</p>
            <p class="body">They don't have real problems</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">I mean, I couldn't imagine going to my dad and telling him that</p>
            <p class="body">Somebody said something to me</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">That hurt your feelings</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">And hurt my feelings, I couldn't imagine</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Well, you know that's a old expression, you know the hard times create hard men</p>
            <p class="body">Hard men create easy times, easy times, create weak men</p>
            <p class="body">Weak men create hard times and it's this is the cycle of</p>
            <p class="body">Existence I remember when I was a kid I was reading about the fall of the Roman Empire and we were just talking about the excess of the Roman Empire during the</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">And there</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">During its demise, and I remember thinking</p>
            <p class="body">I wonder if that's ever going to happen here</p>
            'cause I remember thinking like every civilization in the past that was a great civilization
        </p>
        <p class="body">Whether you know whatever it is, ancient Egypt or whatever ancient civilization that was this dominant</p>
        <p class="body">Massive civilization, they all went away</p>
        <p class="body">They all the ancient Greeks</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">And we're on the fast track</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah Oh my God moving</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">We're we're</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, we're one of the youngest nations, and we're the superpower</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yes, yeah, we're yeah</p>
        <p class="body">One of the youngest nations</p>
        <p class="body">And we're also unique in that we're a nation of immigrants</p>
        <p class="body">It's a a nation consisted entirely of people who moved here</p>
        <p class="body">And and you know, obviously Native Americans as well</p>
        <p class="body">But the the people that moved here are the bulk of the humans</p>
        <p class="body">That are here</p>
        <p class="body">It's so recent I I talked about it in my comedy special. I said the United States was founded in 1776. People lived to be 100 like oh, that's</p>
        <p class="body">Three people ago</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">It's three people go, three people go, three people go</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">They they decided to try to figure out how to</p>
        <p class="body">Create this new</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">And look what we've gone through</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Experiment in self government</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, pretty wild</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Pretty wild, right? </p>
        <p class="body">You know? </p>
        <p class="body">And and I just think you know, like we, we have to keep that in mind and and and again</p>
        <p class="body">But people are just so entitled, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like you know they they</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know like we're the</p>
        <p class="body">I don't want this sound terrible, we're the trust</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Fund babies of the world</p>
        <p class="body">We are the trust fund</p>
        <p class="body">Babies of the world</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know what I mean? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah no, that's not</p>
        <p class="body">I don't think that sounds terrible at all, I think</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I don't want to offend trust fund babies you</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Know I mean, I think that they need a little offending, but it's</p>
        <p class="body">We're spoiled, you know, we we really are</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I, I used to say that about California that California was like</p>
        <p class="body">With the trust fund people, when it comes to the weather, 'cause there's no weather in California, so no one has like a real sense of like what nature can do to you and growing up in Massachusetts? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Except those wild</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, those wildfires are ************ Those are wakeup</p>
        <p class="body">Call those those make people nicer</p>
        <p class="body">You know, in Massachusetts, when it would snow, everybody would kind of get together</p>
        <p class="body">You know you'd help people you see somebody pulled over the side of the road</p>
        <p class="body">People would pull over and try to help them</p>
        <p class="body">They try to get him out of a ditch if they got stuck, they try to help push him or help shovel him</p>
        <p class="body">That was the thing that people like you realize you could</p>
        <p class="body">Die out here like when it's you know 10 below 0 and it's in the middle of ******* January and you you see someone who's hazard lights are on and there's no one else on the road like you feel obligated to help that person</p>
        <p class="body">And there's a thing about nature</p>
        <p class="body">Where it makes you confront your own vulnerability, your own mortality and California doesn't get that very often</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know, and I and I have this theory of</p>
        <p class="body">I don't know</p>
        <p class="body">I just believe that</p>
        <p class="body">The more adversity you've gone through, the more hard times you've gone through, the more power you have to help others, the more struggle you've had, the more you can help others</p>
        <p class="body">Yes, you know, like in the more</p>
        <p class="body">Because in the more vulnerability you can you have right because to help somebody you have to be vulnerable</p>
        <p class="body">You just have to</p>
        <p class="body">To connect with somebody</p>
        <p class="body">You have to be vulnerable</p>
        <p class="body">And people who have</p>
        <p class="body">Gone through stuff</p>
        <p class="body">And came out of it</p>
        <p class="body">They have the power to be vulnerable because they know</p>
        <p class="body">That they're going to get through it</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, it's some</p>
        <p class="body">In order to get people to connect with you, they have to understand that you've experienced some bad situations yourself</p>
        <p class="body">It's not simply just that you know the right way to go about things, and one of the things that Jocko does so well</p>
        <p class="body">Is talk about everything</p>
        <p class="body">Everything your own</p>
        <p class="body">You know, human shortcomings, your own doubts, your own fears, all those things and then how to</p>
        <p class="body">Get through it</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean he like</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Jocko has this way of</p>
        <p class="body">And it's it's it's awesome of like he defuses you before you even know it right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like you could come in and just</p>
        <p class="body">It's just he has this way of like you could have this whole built up</p>
        <p class="body">You know like if I'm if I'm about to go nuclear I I called Jaco or yeah, he'll tell you he he'll tell you</p>
        <p class="body">We talked about our last podcast and I'll call Jaco and</p>
        <p class="body">And he listens</p>
        <p class="body">He listens to you so you kind of like</p>
        <p class="body">You're kind of like running around in a circle and telling him that I've got to, you know, get this whole plan built up, and that's how I see it</p>
        <p class="body">And then he just like he lets you wear yourself out and then he</p>
        <p class="body">And then he comes in and he talks logic, you know he</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, like</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know I'll never forget I called him this one time about this</p>
        <p class="body">This I was so ****** *** at some some stuff that had happened and I was like dude, I'm going to go over here</p>
        <p class="body">I already had this plan that I'm gonna I'm gonna like it's on I'm ready to lose everything</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">And down the COTA</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Settle, yeah, there it was</p>
        <p class="body">He, he listened and he goes</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">OK</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">He goes, he goes check</p>
        <p class="body">And he said, well</p>
        <p class="body">Is it? </p>
        <p class="body">He said, the only time you should fight or the only time you should go at or entertain this stuff with people is is</p>
        <p class="body">Is is one way is if it's willing to are you willing to lose everything? </p>
        <p class="body">Are you willing to are you willing to go all in because you know you do? </p>
        <p class="body">So you you do this and then they buck up to you</p>
        <p class="body">Well, you're gonna lose and look even worse if you don't do something and keep going right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like how far do you wanna take it? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">Right? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">And he's like the only time it's it's it</p>
        <p class="body">It makes sense to engage in something like this is if you're willing to just say, hey, look, I'm it's it's worth me losing everything that I got my freedom, whatever it is he said outside that it ain't worth it</p>
        <p class="body">And when it gets to that point that</p>
        <p class="body">That's your deciding factor</p>
        <p class="body">That's when it's time to</p>
        <p class="body">Engage, yeah, and</p>
        <p class="body">I was like gosh man like he just he</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">Thank you</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But he defuses you, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Like 'cause he, he's not going to, he can't let you wear yourself out and figure it out</p>
        <p class="body">And then he just kind of helps you</p>
        <p class="body">Guide you right like? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Hits you with some logic</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Some logic</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, well he's a leader, you know, Jocko is one of those rare people</p>
        <p class="body">That's an actual real bona fide leader, you know, yeah</p>
        <p class="body">You could talk to him about pretty much anything and he'll be able to look at it rationally</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, he's</p>
        <p class="body">Such a unique guy. Such an incredible guy. He's, uh, that dude's done so much for me, just</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Very unique</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">You know, as a friend in like</p>
        <p class="body">A guy who's just</p>
        <p class="body">That I I oh Jocko so much</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Just think a lot of us do, you know, as a friend and just as an example, as a example of, you know, the way he he likes to describe it</p>
        <p class="body">Extreme ownership, ownership of everything, failures, successes, you know with deal, yeah</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">And he's a real deal, you know, like I hear people hear people talk sometimes, like I just want to be like Jaco and I'm like you'll never be like Jocko, but you can strive to be</p>
        <p class="body">Like Jaco Jaco</p>
        <p class="body">Is he is a superhuman, you know? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, good luck</p>
        <p class="body">I mean you'd have to live his life and you you might not survive</p>
        <p class="body">That's the reality of a Jocko</p>
        <p class="body">Is like Jocko didn't have to make it, you know</p>
        <p class="body">And all the things that he's gone through</p>
        <p class="body">Same with you</p>
        <p class="body">All the things you've gone through you didn't have to make it</p>
        <p class="body">You know you did and you're very fortunate that you did</p>
        <p class="body">But you don't make a person like you</p>
        <p class="body">You don't make a person like Jocko easily, so not easy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I mean it's it's</p>

    <p class="body">How do you treat people? </p>
    'cause that's really all that matters
</p>
<p class="body">And so, like you know this, you know we we're going out</p>
<p class="body">I'm on here today and then we've got</p>
<p class="body">You know some, still some some things tomorrow and this week and then yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">So you just do like a tour</p>
<p class="body">You're going to do any like television shows or any of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">That stuff, no</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's kind of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Over for that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Stuff, it's kind of over like it's the</p>
<p class="body">Podcast game right? </p>
<p class="body">We did some</p>
<p class="body">We been doing podcasts for</p>
<p class="body">The last two weeks so</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so just going around and just trying to spread the word about it</p>
<p class="body">Talk about it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and how long have you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Been doing a podcast now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">So do the American party</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I've been podcasting for like 4 years</p>
<p class="body">I switched around to different formats like</p>
<p class="body">I used to do the interviewing and I just</p>
<p class="body">It's hard to get guest to relying on guest right? </p>
<p class="body">So I do it with Dan Holloway</p>
<p class="body">We do the American Party and it's just about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Like just talk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Just talk it's about principles, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">So I mean she's about principles</p>
<p class="body">It's about, you know, I don't care</p>
<p class="body">If you're left or</p>
<p class="body">Right like look I I just care if you're a good person and and that's pretty simple</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's lots more simple than whether you know the the left and right things complicated</p>
<p class="body">It's like the reasons why people are left versus the reason why people are right and what what</p>
<p class="body">What do you define as left versus? </p>
<p class="body">What do you define as right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, I think that's a it's a complicated conversation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">It's a complicated conversation</p>
<p class="body">I don't even know if</p>
<p class="body">If they're even loyal to that right, and and so it's just, you know, we we do the American Party podcast and we we just</p>
<p class="body">We try to break it down to to looking at it from what's best for the people</p>
<p class="body">What's best for people and and you know those are principles</p>
<p class="body">Those are principles of</p>
<p class="body">You know to do good to do good for others, to do, good for yourself</p>
<p class="body">You know it's all this stuff</p>
<p class="body">I'm not smart enough to make things complicated</p>
<p class="body">So I just have to keep himself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Me yeah, well, you know there's some people that love making things more complicated</p>
<p class="body">They they they get off</p>
<p class="body">On it, it's like a little</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">There's confusion there</p>
<p class="body">There's power when confusion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's like a rush in explaining things in a way that baffles most people</p>
<p class="body">Where you go, wait? </p>
<p class="body">A minute, what are you saying? </p>
<p class="body">Exactly, and they're using all these fancy words and elaborating, and a beautiful you know pontificating in a beautiful way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">It sounds good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Sounds good, sounds good, but it doesn't sound good if you don't know what the **** they just said like some some people are too smart</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Something sounds good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I'll talk to him like hold on slow down, what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Did you just say can you break yeah</p>
<p class="body">Understand talk to me like I'm 5</p>
<p class="body">That's how I have to do</p>
<p class="body">Everything so you do it once</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">A week
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">No, it's twice a week, maybe twice a week</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Twice a week? </p>
    <p class="body">Oh, that's cool</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, so we do Wednesdays and Fridays</p>
    <p class="body">I I love it</p>
    <p class="body">I love it, you know, I just just try to break down things that are going on and and like how it's going to affect us, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like does this really matter or not? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, how many times are we focused on things that really don't matter, you know, and</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">A lot</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And that's what I talk about</p>
    <p class="body">You know, in this book of, you know, so I'm a helicopter pilot</p>
    <p class="body">And so, like I</p>
    <p class="body">You know there's a lot of things going on when you're flying a helicopter and</p>
    <p class="body">If you try to focus on every single gauge while you're flying, like you're never, you can't get through all of them</p>
    <p class="body">But like you know, I'm always looking out the windshield. 90% out the windshield I I use a nine in one technique and so 90% out the windshield making sure I'm not running into things</p>
    <p class="body">And then you know 10% inside looking at like 3-3 gauges that matter to me, right? Because I know if those gauges are good if something else goes wrong</p>
    <p class="body">I can auto rotate it down right and it's the same thing in life like let's just stay focused on what matters</p>
    <p class="body">Quit getting distracted on on</p>
    <p class="body">The the static stop giving things more legs than you know are you having</p>
    <p class="body">Are you having a bad day or do you have a bad life or are you having a bad day or are you having a bad moment? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    'cause stop giving them like
</p>
<p class="body">Obviously we all have negative things and and we all have obstacles in our lives</p>
<p class="body">But like</p>
<p class="body">Don't give it more power</p>
<p class="body">Then it's then it really is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Right then it deserves</p>
<p class="body">Then it deserves, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's there's</p>
<p class="body">You know there's a great expression that I've talked about before, but it bears it's worth mentioning</p>
<p class="body">Again, there's an expression</p>
<p class="body">The worst thing that's ever happened to you is the worst thing that's ever</p>
<p class="body">Happened to you</p>
<p class="body">No matter what</p>
<p class="body">It is like if you've had a sheltered life and the worst thing that ever happened to you</p>
<p class="body">If someone said something that hurt your feelings, that is the</p>
<p class="body">Worst thing that's ever happened to you</p>
<p class="body">And we see that with children right? </p>
<p class="body">With little kids it's like 'cause they they haven't had a lot of life experiences</p>
<p class="body">And then we see people that have gone through hell and those people you know, I don't want my children to go through hell, but those people are more resilient</p>
<p class="body">They're different, they they, they have more</p>
<p class="body">They've they've got more life experiences that to judge it against</p>
<p class="body">So a thing like someone being mean to them</p>
<p class="body">You know, if you grow up in some hard part, some Eastern bloc country where it's things are rough</p>
<p class="body">Like you don't want to hear any of that ********
    <p class="body">Like that, like just an insult, that's</p>
    <p class="body">Not enough? Yeah, that's not</p>
    <p class="body">The worst thing that's ever happened to them</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But we just have to like we have to stop trying to out victimize each other, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like, like look the words like you said, look the worst day of your life</p>
    <p class="body">The worst day of my life is no more significant than the worst day of your life</p>
    <p class="body">There's both the worst days of our life</p>
    <p class="body">And if we stop trying to out victimize each other or see who's seen worse or done worse, or been through worse and we're just like, hey, look like like, hey, here's what</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I've been through</p>
    <p class="body">Man, we can get</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Through this, but there's a culture in this country, unfortunately that</p>
    <p class="body">Has arisen, you know, within my lifetime of victim</p>
    <p class="body">Like there's just like a</p>
    <p class="body">A currency to victimhood</p>
    <p class="body">Like the more things are stacked against you, the more you get to complain about those things stacked against you</p>
    <p class="body">The more you get</p>
    <p class="body">To like wear</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It becomes your identity</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, it becomes your identity, right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's a it's a problem</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And it is a problem, right and? </p>
    <p class="body">Because we reward it right like there's and there's no accountability to to to get through it</p>
    <p class="body">And and like there's more reward to having that and being able to talk about it</p>
    <p class="body">And being able to use as your identity then there is to put the work in to get better</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, right like and a lot of times we just don't want to</p>
    <p class="body">That's what I'm fortunate about with my friends is my friends I I tell a story in here</p>
    <p class="body">About 10, you know</p>
    <p class="body">When I was going through my divorce and when I first moved to Austin on it was</p>
    <p class="body">On it was</p>
    <p class="body">A critical piece to me</p>
    <p class="body">It was kind of like the only</p>
    <p class="body">Stable, consistent place</p>
    <p class="body">I could go to working out with Tim and one and and uh, and Eric and and John Wolf and and all of them</p>
    <p class="body">Those guys like literally just I knew if I could make it to the gym that I was going to have an album</p>
    <p class="body">Two hours I'd be alright and</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Perhaps yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And I'll never forget I walked into Tampa and I was like, man, I'm we were doing some work out and I'm like I'm I'm just</p>
    <p class="body">Fat, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like just just just</p>
    <p class="body">Probably looking for some empathy right? </p>
    <p class="body">And Tim looks at me and goes</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, and hey, check it out</p>
    <p class="body">Your people look at you as a warrior and you need to look like 1</p>
    <p class="body">So fix it</p>
    <p class="body">And it's like</p>
    <p class="body">You know I didn't need him to be like Oh no man it it's OK, you know you you you look all right</p>
    <p class="body">I needed somebody to sit here and tell me like hey, yeah, you know what you're you're spot on</p>
    <p class="body">At least we identified the problem</p>
    <p class="body">So now it's time to to get busy fixing it</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, yeah, and that can be done</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But it doesn't feel good</p>
    <p class="body">You know? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, that's the point though</p>
    <p class="body">That's that's what fat shaming is all about, but</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But don't you think it's offensive, but don't you think I could have sit here and been offended, offended by that? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Oh yeah, for sure you your feelings could have been hurt and you could have went straight to the donut shop and it's been like **** him</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, this is one of the things we see today with a lot of people online</p>
    <p class="body">Whether this whole body positivity thing, it's like it's it's nonsense</p>
    <p class="body">Like, yes, it's awful</p>
    <p class="body">If someone is mean to you purposely and hurts your feelings and mocks you for the way you look</p>
    <p class="body">Because you're obese, yes, that's not nice at all</p>
    <p class="body">But this whole idea that</p>
    <p class="body">You love it and this is who you are and everybody should just accept it</p>
    <p class="body">And then</p>
    <p class="body">Pretending that it's healthy, which is really weird, like people will distort the reality of medical science and pretend that there's not like some real significant</p>
    <p class="body">Effect that obesity has on all parts of your body all sorts of things go wrong if you're obese, but we send this message to people that body positivity is the way to go</p>
    <p class="body">That it's OK, but it's not OK</p>
    <p class="body">It's not</p>
    <p class="body">You mean it's like it sucks</p>
    <p class="body">If someone can point something out and like, hey, you have let this lapse you have</p>
    <p class="body">Treated your body in a poor way and because of that you have a significant problem and you got to do something about it</p>
    <p class="body">Like Tim said, do you fix it? </p>
    <p class="body">That is</p>
    <p class="body">That's a reality of so many ******* people out there and they don't ever get that speech and they don't ever fix it</p>
    <p class="body">And instead they try to come up with reasons why it's OK to be obese</p>
    <p class="body">It's not OK to be obese, it's terrible</p>
    <p class="body">It's terrible for you</p>
    <p class="body">It's terrible for the people around you</p>
    <p class="body">It's because you're gonna you</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It's selfish</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Know fish</p>
    <p class="body">You're going to get sick</p>
    <p class="body">You're going to get you know it's going to be a real problem</p>
    <p class="body">People don't want to hear it</p>
    <p class="body">They want to think that somehow or another</p>
    <p class="body">It's OK and</p>
    <p class="body">Especially during the pandemic, like my God, it's like one of the main factors for whether or not you're going to be healthy</p>
    <p class="body">And whether or not you're going to survive this ******* thing</p>
    <p class="body">It's, uh, you know, one of the main factors is obesity</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, and I just like you know, the frustrating part to me was just</p>
    <p class="body">I got it</p>
    <p class="body">I got it look</p>
    <p class="body">Do whatever makes you feel safe</p>
    <p class="body">I'm in whatever I don't care what? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, right it is</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">That is</p>
    <p class="body">Whatever, whatever you've done, just do it</p>
    <p class="body">Do it</p>
    <p class="body">I don't care, leave me alone</p>
    <p class="body">And look if you</p>
    <p class="body">I just I just never forget I was in the grocery store and</p>
    <p class="body">I didn't obviously didn't have a mask on</p>
    <p class="body">I was being selfish</p>
    me and I walked in
</p>
<p class="body">I wasn't around anybody but like this woman was in</p>
<p class="body">I mean she was</p>
<p class="body">She was very obese</p>
<p class="body">And her cart was</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I remember looking in</p>
<p class="body">There and it</p>
<p class="body">Was like just junk food</p>
<p class="body">And she's like screaming at me, telling me how basically how much of a ***** ** **** I am for not having my mask on, and I'm endangering everyone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Was there a mask mandate? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, at the time they didn't tell me</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I could go in the store without it, so like they weren't, nobody mentioned it to me</p>
<p class="body">You did work there, right? </p>
<p class="body">It was</p>
<p class="body">Only people who were, but either either way it</p>
<p class="body">Was like a check</p>
<p class="body">I got it OK, I'll put my mask on if you need me</p>
<p class="body">Put my mask on</p>
<p class="body">I wasn't on airplane</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I'll put my mask on right? </p>
<p class="body">If that makes you feel</p>
<p class="body">Better I got you</p>
<p class="body">But I just don't understand like why do we only look at parts of it? </p>
<p class="body">Like OK, I'll put the mask under protect you, but if you want to protect yourself you should</p>
<p class="body">You should maybe start eating healthy or you should maybe make healthier decisions all the way around</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">But that's hard to do</p>
<p class="body">It's very easy to yell at you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Again, and that's when I felt like as so many so many people were blaming me for their problems</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know what I mean</p>
<p class="body">And look, obviously I got it was real</p>
<p class="body">I got it checked</p>
<p class="body">I'm not arguing that</p>
<p class="body">I'm just saying that like, let's now that now that let's say we're</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if we're at</p>
<p class="body">I don't even know where we're at in the pandemic anymore</p>
<p class="body">Like I, I don't know, but</p>
<p class="body">Can I walk around and and when I see somebody who looks very, very unhealthy and I know that the science supports that, can I walk up to him be like hey, you don't need to be eating that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">No, because that only affects them</p>
<p class="body">Think about you with the mask</p>
<p class="body">Is it? </p>
<p class="body">You know, I don't think masks, especially most of the masks that people use</p>
<p class="body">Unless you're wearing an N95 mask, which most people aren't like, a really snug fit. N95 mask</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it's really doing much</p>
<p class="body">Those cloth masks, and especially those surgical masks</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I don't think</p>
<p class="body">It's doing much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Those cloth masks that you wear over like that</p>
<p class="body">They like</p>
<p class="body">It's almost like these like</p>
<p class="body">What do they called like bandanas over their face? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, nonsense</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Well, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">It's nonsense and there's studies are showing that it's nonsense, that's it</p>
<p class="body">Statistically, it doesn't really have that much of an effect. Again, like I had Michael Osterholm on recently and he's explaining why an end 95 mask works and that it has like what did he say? </p>
<p class="body">It was like an electrical static</p>
<p class="body">What did he say about why the</p>
<p class="body">Things actually cling to the mask</p>
<p class="body">Like it prevents transmission because</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Prostatic chart</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, so it's something about like if you are sick and you have one of those on it actually does significantly reduce the amount of viral load comes out</p>
<p class="body">Of your mouth</p>
<p class="body">But most people aren't wearing those</p>
<p class="body">They're wearing these ******** masks</p>
<p class="body">And here's the thing, man, it's like</p>
<p class="body">If you want to</p>
<p class="body">Go to a place and you want to</p>
<p class="body">I mean if if there's a mask law and you're not wearing a mask, that's one thing</p>
<p class="body">But if you want to go to a place and it's optional, and you've got your mask on and other people don't and you're you're screaming and yell at them</p>
<p class="body">Like you're just you, you can't, especially if you're obese and you've got a cart full of **** you're concentrating on the wrong thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">So where I mean but where like but again? </p>
<p class="body">Where's the self responsibility? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">There's not, but it's so easy to point a finger at mean old Dakota running around with no mask on you ***** ** **** ***** wrong with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Where is it? </p>
<p class="body">You yeah, I mean what what number? </p>
<p class="body">What number in in the country? </p>
<p class="body">What as far as the world? </p>
<p class="body">How unhealthy like we wanted one of the richest countries in the world? </p>
<p class="body">What what level? </p>
<p class="body">Where we at on the health</p>
<p class="body">The health scale</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">That's a good question</p>
<p class="body">Let's let's guess let's guess, let's say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
17th or no. As far as I know. Let's go this the most as far as unhealthy like the unhealthiest. I bet we're #7 or 6 or 7</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">In terms of the unhealthiest country</p>

        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">There's a lot going into the question</p>
        <p class="body">Isn't that crazy though? Yeah</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, well we're the most obese, but that's a weird thing because we have all this access to food</p>
        <p class="body">And a lot of it is really unhealthy and it's easy to get</p>
        <p class="body">Like the easiest food to get is like you could just pull into a burger place</p>
        <p class="body">Get a milkshake ******* sugary soda</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But we also have access to the most healthy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Get fries</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, food in the</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">World, but it's not as easy</p>
        <p class="body">And it's it's, uh, it's not as cheap</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">So that's laziness, so it's like</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">It is</p>
        <p class="body">It's also it's like you know people don't have a lot of time</p>
        <p class="body">Unfortunately, like the the other thing about us is the time requirements that our job takes</p>
        <p class="body">Like your job takes a lot of ******* time</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Isn't that is that the narrative that we've like is that what we just? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, you're? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I think you're you're a</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Busy person, yeah, I'm a busy person, but not compared to a person that has a job that they hate</p>
        <p class="body">That's the that's the thing</p>
        <p class="body">It's like you're you're busy</p>
        <p class="body">But you're busy doing something that robs you of your soul, and that's a lot of people</p>
        <p class="body">A lot of people are out there, busy, but they're they're busy doing something that drains them</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, when I leave here I'm like that was a good conversation</p>
        <p class="body">Dakota is cool</p>
        <p class="body">That was fun</p>
        <p class="body">That's why I'm gonna feel</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I'm gonna feel drained</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I'm gonna feel like that was a good conversation</p>
        <p class="body">You know when? </p>
        <p class="body">I do stand up tonight, same thing</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But have you always? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, have you have? </p>
        <p class="body">You always had that no no when I</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">And and</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Was younger I didn't have that when you were younger, did</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">And when you were younger, did you still work out? </p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, so my point is, is that if you if you, whether you want to do something or whether you don't, you'll find an excuse</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">That's true, but also</p>
        <p class="body">I will</p>
        <p class="body">The reality is like my struggle, years were not that long like like while I was struggling and while I was working out I was young</p>
        <p class="body">I had tons of energy</p>
        <p class="body">I was driven and I had a plan or I wanted to get somewhere I wanted to</p>
        <p class="body">I wanted to get I wanted to have success and fortunately it came true and I I did have success and I did do all that stuff</p>
        <p class="body">But the people that haven't, and they're obese now</p>
        <p class="body">They have a bunch of **** going on</p>
        <p class="body">First of all they have low energy levels</p>
        <p class="body">It's very difficult to get something done when you have low energy levels</p>
        <p class="body">It's so hard because whatever motivation I need</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, I'm kind of on autopilot now, like when I get up in the morning like I know I'm gonna work out</p>
        <p class="body">It's not like whether or not I can't</p>
        <p class="body">Well, maybe I'll blow it off today</p>
        <p class="body">I ******* never say that I get in there</p>
        <p class="body">I always work out so it's not like whether or not it's going to get done</p>
        <p class="body">It's going to get done, it's just it's a part of it</p>
        <p class="body">It's brushing my teeth</p>
        <p class="body">It's taking a **** it's normal</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But everything said everything is obituary</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Whatever I go out there it is, but when you but my point is like I have momentum and I have health, right? </p>
        <p class="body">So I'm I'm fit, I eat right? </p>
        <p class="body">I take a lot of vitamins</p>
        <p class="body">I'm doing all the right things in that regard</p>
        <p class="body">So I have the energy to go out there and workout for obese people</p>
        <p class="body">It's so ******* hard because your body</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Drained, but you're so you're telling me</p>
        <p class="body">Do you think? </p>
        <p class="body">That majority these people were talking about</p>
        <p class="body">Do you? </p>
        <p class="body">How much time do you think they spend? </p>
        <p class="body">On their phones</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Just spend a lot of time on the phones, but that's easy to do</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Well, but</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">The thing you know what I'm saying is like it's not as easy for me</p>
        <p class="body">This is just my my own personal realization</p>
        <p class="body">My understanding of like the human body when you're really fat, it's</p>
        <p class="body">Very hard to get going</p>
        <p class="body">It's very hard</p>
        <p class="body">They don't</p>
        <p class="body">Their bodies are ******** like they don't have the energy to do it, and that's just the reality of</p>
        <p class="body">What it means to be an obese person? </p>
        <p class="body">So what they have to do is force themselves</p>
        <p class="body">You know they don't have like this feeling like ah, I can't wait to get to the gym</p>
        <p class="body">That feeling it's not there, their feeling is OK</p>
        <p class="body">I know that this is a process</p>
        <p class="body">It's a long, brutal process, but I must begin it and it must be a part of every day and that's the</p>
        <p class="body">Only way I'm gonna get out of</p>
        <p class="body">This hold it up</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Doug, I mean I don't</p>
        <p class="body">I don't wake up and have that and I work out</p>
        <p class="body">Six days a week. I don't, and I mean and I built a gym on my property like 300 yards from my house</p>
        <p class="body">And I still have to fight myself</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, to get up to go workout at it, right? </p>
        <p class="body">I can all you know, I just</p>
        <p class="body">It's a choice</p>

        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">About it, so it's</p>
        <p class="body">Priority is who the **** has more disciplined than Goggins? </p>

        <p class="body">Like you know, like where you're just</p>
        <p class="body">I just talked to myself different</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>

        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">That's when I respond</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">I respect the **** out of that too and I love him to death, but I don't</p>
        <p class="body">Think his mindset is healthy</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Never in peace</p>
        <p class="body">Maybe he's never in</p>
        <p class="body">Peace, maybe? </p>
        <p class="body">I mean, it's probably not healthy</p>
        <p class="body">If he was going to be like</p>
        <p class="body">A youth pastor, but</p>
        <p class="body">For him to for him to achieve the goals he got, he wants</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">I mean, he's</p>
        <p class="body">Just achieve the goals he wants, but here's what's maybe as important with with him is that Goggins inspires so many people to action</p>
        <p class="body">There's so many people that watch his videos and they go</p>
        <p class="body">That is an exceptional human being so exceptional</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">But it's because he's not like this</p>
        <p class="body">He's not trying to be well groomed, he's not trying to like worry about offending people like David Goggins is so clear that he doesn't give a **** what you think about him and whether you're watching his video or not, he's going to still</p>
        <p class="body">Be getting after</p>

            <p class="body">Yeah a hard workout</p>
            <p class="body">Like you know the things if you ever notice like the things that bother you like that are on your mind before you start working out versus when you're done</p>
            <p class="body">Totally different, you got totally</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Totally different life</p>
            <p class="body">It's like life is OK, like a ******* brutal workout after it's over</p>
            <p class="body">Like whoo, yeah</p>
            <p class="body">I'm gonna be alright</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
            <p class="body">Yeah, it's</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
            <p class="body">You know, honestly, that wasn't</p>
            <p class="body">That big of</p>
            <p class="body">A deal so</p>
            <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
            <p class="body">Sorry, big of a deal</p>
            <p class="body">It's like that's a form of therapy</p>
            <p class="body">It's a, it's A and it's also a form of therapy that requires you to engage and to work</p>
            <p class="body">And I think that is just as much an important aspect of it as anything is that you're forcing yourself to do something that's very difficult</p>
            <p class="body">And through that you get this alleviation of anxiety and stress and all the good stuff, and it's great for your body</p>
            <p class="body">But also it's</p>
            <p class="body">Great for your mind because your mind did the work you made your mind</p>
            <p class="body">Your mind is what? </p>
            <p class="body">Tells your body what the **** to do</p>
            <p class="body">You know my friend John Joseph? </p>
            <p class="body">He's he's the lead singer the Kromaggs and he's done a bunch of **** ton of triathlons and a bunch of ironmans and one of the things that I love about what he loves about triathlons and Ironman</p>
            <p class="body">He says he 'cause your mind has to tell your body</p>
            <p class="body">Who the **** The boss is, yeah</p>
            <p class="body">You know your mind</p>
            'cause your body is like oh this is ******** Let's quit and your mind
        </p>
        <p class="body">Is like **** you keep</p>
        <p class="body">Going your mind can control the body</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
        <p class="body">That's what</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I love</p>
        <p class="body">I I love</p>
        <p class="body">I love those workouts where it's just like</p>
        <p class="body">Where it's like</p>
        <p class="body">Anybody could do it and you know you could take off like I try to do everything like these workouts I'm talking about for time, right? </p>
        <p class="body">Because you know, it's it's like you can take off 'cause you can get through anything</p>
        <p class="body">You can pace yourself</p>
        <p class="body">You know all these things and for me I just like I like to get to that dark place and I like to just get in there and I just like</p>
        <p class="body">To you know for me, I don't</p>
        <p class="body">I'm not going to go talk</p>
        <p class="body">Like I, I'm not very good at talking to to people about my problems</p>
        <p class="body">I feel like I'm inconveniencing them and then when I verbalize them</p>
        <p class="body">They're not that big, so</p>
        <p class="body">You know? </p>
        <p class="body">So for me like this is kind of like my time</p>
        <p class="body">To my counseling session with myself, I don't say anything and at the end of it I come out and I feel better, you know</p>
        <p class="body">But I I'm physically be I'm mentally just I love just getting to that dark place where it's just like Oh yeah, this is</p>
        <p class="body">This is where I like it and</p>
        <p class="body">I come out of it and I'm like done</p>
        <p class="body">I'm ready, ready to get after it again like I'm I'm relieved, you know</p>
        <p class="body">But I gotta</p>
        <p class="body">Sometimes I just gotta</p>
        <p class="body">I have to get in there</p>
        <p class="body">I just have to push myself harder and just just be like no like you're I'm going to quit on my terms</p>
        <p class="body">Yeah, I'm going to stop on my terms not when my body gets tired I'm gonna stop when I say I'm tired</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah, well, I think with a lot of people what's going on is society's created these tensions and these problems</p>
        <p class="body">That our body doesn't totally understand and I think our body thinks of conflicts as being danger to our body</p>
        <p class="body">Like physically dangerous conflicts, that's what I think our body thinks of conflicts of anything that you've got that's going on is giving you stress</p>
        <p class="body">Our body thinks we're going to have to go to war like you're going to have to fight off a neighboring tribe, you're</p>
        <p class="body">Going to have to fight off a predator</p>
        <p class="body">There's gonna be the way we evolved as a as an intelligent being, the way we got to today is we had to fight off a lot of **** and so your body is programmed to fight off a lot of **** now all of a sudden you get to this place in 2022 where you're not really fighting anything off, but you have those same feelings and I, I think until you</p>
        <p class="body">Wreck your body and just tax it out it it can't think rationally</p>
        <p class="body">I think all those people that have like major anxiety and major problems and don't have a rigorous workout schedule</p>
        <p class="body">I think they do themselves a disservice</p>
        'cause I don't think you're able to think as clearly
    </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Do you think that like? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, how many people do you think are out there? </p>
    <p class="body">That have never been punched in the</p>
    <p class="body">Mouth a lot</p>
    <p class="body">And go back every generation</p>
    <p class="body">Right, like my dad's generation and then he goes</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">They all got punched</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And don't you think 'cause like and don't you think like? </p>
    <p class="body">So I believe the biggest issue in in in in just America I just talk America</p>
    <p class="body">Is there's no accountability right? </p>
    <p class="body">But there is no accountability without conflict and everybody so scared of conflict because like now it's to the point where I can talk **** to you on</p>
    <p class="body">Over text</p>
    <p class="body">Yes, you can't punch me in the mouth or over text right? </p>
    <p class="body">And so like there's no accountability and we've, we've dodged all this</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I mean, I remember like when I was in high school</p>
    <p class="body">I mean we would fight and then we're friends the next day, and I mean, you know, that's how it was</p>
    <p class="body">And now it's like</p>
    <p class="body">It's just</p>
    <p class="body">Crazy **** right? </p>
    <p class="body">But but it's like</p>
    <p class="body">There's no accountability in this</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's also where the same thing with the same animal that we were your dad's generation. Your grandpa generation with the same creature, but now we have different rules and those rules aren't necessarily compatible with the way our body set</p>
    <p class="body">Up now</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, we're we're built the we're built</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">To fight, yeah well it's been a it's not whether or not we're built to fight</p>
    <p class="body">We're accustomed to it in our lives</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, it's it's</p>
    <p class="body">It's a part of what got us here to 2022. This is how the human race is here</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, and I'm not</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's not like we just laid down whatever conflict came because we'd all be dead</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But it how many times? </p>
    <p class="body">So what happens, you know, like you take these generations as we you know we're scared of conflict</p>
    <p class="body">Life is conflict</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">There's a lot of conflict in life</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">There's a lot of like</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">And there's a lot of</p>
    <p class="body">Lessons that you learn through</p>
    <p class="body">Conflict well</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Exactly, and it's like how what's going to happen when you know it got, God forbid that that this country into two more two more generations</p>
    <p class="body">Somebody comes here that wants conflict</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">The real fear is that that happens, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Or the real fear is the conflict comes now and we're not prepared for it</p>
    <p class="body">And by the time we adjust, it's too late</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean that's that's the issue is</p>
    <p class="body">What would it take to snap America back into a position where we value? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, imagine what you do and imagine what I do with Jocko does and Tim Kennedy does</p>
    <p class="body">Imagine if the whole country adopted a way of life</p>
    <p class="body">You eat healthy</p>
    <p class="body">You train almost every day and you think about your problems</p>
    <p class="body">You think about accountability</p>
    <p class="body">You think about your personality</p>
    <p class="body">You think about</p>
    <p class="body">Interpersonal conflicts you've been in with friends or with coworkers or what have you, and you try to do better constantly</p>
    <p class="body">We'd be infinitely better country that's not infinitely better</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It's not, it's not</p>
    <p class="body">It's not good for it's not good for business, so it's</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Why isn't good for business? </p>
    <p class="body">You buy things I</p>
    <p class="body">Buy things, yeah, but I</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Mean like it's</p>
    <p class="body">What's business when you're not depressed and when you're not, you know when you don't have anxiety, you know when you feel better and you have more energy</p>
    <p class="body">And I mean this and it just</p>
    <p class="body">It's it's a I</p>
    <p class="body">I just feel yeah, I mean, I just think that I just think that everything goes back to</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You mean like pharmaceutical business, yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">You know, I mean, everything goes back, convenience and things like that</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, obviously it's nice, but you know the the</p>
    <p class="body">The more people rely on other like these other things to to do in their daily life, there's more money</p>
    <p class="body">To be made there</p>
    <p class="body">Right? </p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, and I just think it's it's just like</p>
    <p class="body">I I don't know</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, you can't tell people hey look like yeah, I mean it's it's just so tough right now and it's like so tough because like I'm I'm raising my daughters in this and it's like what is it? </p>
    <p class="body">Going to look like for them</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's definitely different than it was for us, but I'm wondering, you know, if we're going to figure this out the way we figured out every other generation and learn from the mistakes of the past generations and</p>
    <p class="body">And get better at it</p>
    <p class="body">I'm I'm, you know, I'm still optimistic, although I I do see a lot of ******* really troubling **** with the way people are handling stuff</p>
    <p class="body">And in in society today</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean I yeah, I mean, look America, we're going to be fine like like now will be fine we'll be fine I'll I'll put everything on it will be fine</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean for</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Sure, you're not worried about China or Russia or any this crazy stuff you don't think like Putin is capable of</p>
    <p class="body">Like launching a nuke</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">No, I mean, where is he going to launch? </p>
    <p class="body">It to us I</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Think it's possible that there could come a time where Putin is experiencing so much pushback that he decides to go nuclear? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">So it's kind of like here, right like? </p>
    <p class="body">It's, you know when I mean and Millie even admitted this, who did General Millie Joint Chiefs? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">What do you? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Say when he told China that he would call them before he looked like</p>
    <p class="body">It went under</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Well, that was when</p>
    <p class="body">You're talking about Trump, right? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, so so again again</p>
    <p class="body">You know, if yeah if if Putin himself was the only person that had to to launch that nuke</p>
    <p class="body">But they're still like if Putin launches a nuke on us</p>
    <p class="body">What's going to happen right behind it? </p>
    <p class="body">Everybody in in Russia is about to suffer</p>
    <p class="body">You know what I mean, and I think that like that aspect of</p>
    <p class="body">That aspect is</p>
    <p class="body">That's why North Korea rock the nuke, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Like like these these nukes</p>
    <p class="body">I just don't think</p>
    <p class="body">And maybe I'm just being optimistic</p>
    <p class="body">I just don't think that like I think people will do things whenever they're sure that it's not going to affect them, but I think that like the humanisation factor of, oh, I'm</p>
    <p class="body">I'm going to push this</p>
    <p class="body">I'm going to support and I'm going to have to push this nuke button or whatever whatever it is, key or whatever</p>
    <p class="body">And but I also know that as soon as I do that, like I'm going to get the first hit, but my family is going to suffer</p>
    <p class="body">And everybody here is going to suffer</p>
    <p class="body">I just again like they're worried about him dropping nukes inside of Ukraine</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Well, well, what he said and this is where it gets disturbing what he said is that if anybody supports Ukraine and you know the idea of NATO moves weapons into Ukraine and and put points in Russia, they I believe his quote was something to the nature of they will face horrors the likes of which</p>
    <p class="body">The world has never</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, so is he committing suicide? </p>
    <p class="body">So I if he</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Mean, but I mean look how old is? </p>
    <p class="body">He how old</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Is he, I mean, but that's</p>
    <p class="body">Some how</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Old is he</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">How old Putin. 667 seventy age price maybe 670? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">The 70s</p>
    6969 OK so
</p>
<p class="body">Who knows what his health is like? </p>
<p class="body">Who knows how much time he's got? </p>
<p class="body">Let me you when you got a guy who's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">A dictator</p>
<p class="body">But then you got people under him who have to push the button</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">How does that work over there do? </p>
<p class="body">They have a similar situation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, some somebody has to do it right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, he he's not he</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Doing it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean he ain't like a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">But if he orders the first, I mean he hasn't he given them orders to get close to get ready</p>
<p class="body">Hasn't he put some sort of a nuclear? </p>
<p class="body">What did he? </p>
<p class="body">What was his? </p>
<p class="body">His order that he gave out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">We just popped up the level of readiness or whatever</p>
<p class="body">I don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Right, what does that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Know something? </p>
<p class="body">Mean I</p>
<p class="body">I mean, maybe maybe they point him, I don't know</p>
<p class="body">Maybe they get on</p>
<p class="body">My hand in the right direction listen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">But the human race has nuked</p>
<p class="body">Countries we have or not us obviously is before our time, but well, that's enough</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">We're the only we're the only ones</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">It's just like listen</p>
<p class="body">It's not that long ago</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it seems like a long time ago, 1947, but if you look at in terms of like the overall time that humans have been on this planet, that's pretty recent</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">But at night</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Like if we look at Roman history or Greek history like a 50 year or 60 or 70 year</p>
<p class="body">Gap in between something is not much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">But you also had, like</p>
<p class="body">We also had the support</p>
<p class="body">Like nobody like this had affected everybody right? </p>
<p class="body">And like</p>
<p class="body">Nobody like we didn't worry about somebody rocking a</p>
<p class="body">Nuke back at us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">We didn't know if they had it</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">So now we know</p>
<p class="body">We know everybody who's got the nukes, yeah, and so and everybody knows like who's got em, who's got what I mean it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">All obvious, but you know that during the 60s there was some generals that were legitimately thinking about launching nukes against Russia against China against Cuba</p>
<p class="body">There was real talk about this</p>
<p class="body">Like that's what the whole Doctor Strange love movies about</p>
<p class="body">We we actually talked about it yesterday</p>
<p class="body">It's really was based on real people that had these ideas and thought they were actually going to go wind up doing that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean I</p>
<p class="body">Just look, anybody can do anything like people can do anything</p>
<p class="body">I just don't think that I just</p>
<p class="body">I mean I, I maybe maybe I just don't see</p>
<p class="body">Like you know when they're talking about nukes inside of</p>
<p class="body">Inside of Ukraine right now I mean</p>
<p class="body">So, but I mean you talk about Putin literally losing it. Like he. I mean he's done, like if he drops a nuke 100%, he's done</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Is he though? </p>
<p class="body">Because what if he says I'm going to keep doing this unless you guys back the **** *** but I</p>
<p class="body">Did it once, So what do you? </p>
<p class="body">What what happens then? But honestly, what happens then? Because then we go to war, then everybody dies, right? If we just launch missiles at him and he launches missiles at the United States, mutually assured destruction, right? It you think if 11 nuclear bomb goes off somewhere? </p>
<p class="body">That that would automatically mean a nuclear war</p>
<p class="body">Or do you think people would try to still negotiate? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Depends on where he sends</p>
<p class="body">It right? </p>
<p class="body">So I mean like</p>
<p class="body">Do you do? </p>
<p class="body">You think for one second and I don't know</p>
<p class="body">I like there's legit questions right</p>
<p class="body">Do you feel like he's going to drop it in Ukraine while all of his people are there and that his own people aren't? </p>
<p class="body">Going to turn on</p>
<p class="body">Him and be like what the ****
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't know</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I feel like if he pulls out of Ukraine, pulls the troops out of Ukraine and then nukes it</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, it sounds crazy</p>
    <p class="body">I don't think</p>
    <p class="body">Look obviously I'm not a ******* military analyst</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, obviously if he's pulling troops</p>
    <p class="body">Out of yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I'm not a person</p>
    <p class="body">Who really either? </p>
    <p class="body">But what I'm saying is who the **** thought that we were going to have a hot war with Russia invades Ukraine with tanks and jets and and they're shooting missiles, new apartment buildings? </p>
    <p class="body">That's ******* crazy</p>
    <p class="body">And nobody thought that was going to happen just a few months ago</p>
    <p class="body">And now it's real</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean again, I'm with you</p>
    <p class="body">I mean we we went in, we've gone into Iraq</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, you know, I mean, I just don't see</p>
    <p class="body">I just don't see</p>
    <p class="body">I don't see him going nuclear and I just don't</p>
    <p class="body">See, I mean</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">And I don't see it, but it's possible</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, he thinks possible</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">But that's the thing</p>
    <p class="body">It's like it's not just possible, we're in a they are</p>
    <p class="body">Rather he's in a war right now</p>
    <p class="body">There's a real war like Ukraine and Russia are in a real war that scares the</p>
    **** out of me man
</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, China is the one that scares</p>
<p class="body">Me that scares me</p>
<p class="body">Too, I mean China scares me</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I think I think Russia, you know, I think Russia is kind of showed their hands right like? </p>
<p class="body">Russia has kind of been like to my generation</p>
<p class="body">The guy in the bar that you know you walk into</p>
<p class="body">You've never seen him fight, but everybody like, oh, don't mess with that guy, right like? </p>
<p class="body">Don't you just don't ever even mess with him, right? Everybody's been like well, why all you know he's so ******
    <p class="body">And I think Putin's more screwed because he's kind of showed that</p>
    <p class="body">That I mean, if he can't take on Ukraine, he better not try to come to anybody else</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Unless unless they use nuclear</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Unless he's go nuclear well again, unless he goes nuclear</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, that's the that's the thing that's ****** is like when he said</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't think</p>
    <p class="body">China would even support him going nuclear</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Do they have to look if he's going nuclear? </p>
    <p class="body">It's a suicide mission, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, if you think it's like you gotta always be afraid of someone who is a dictator who has ultimate power who's also a psychopath</p>
    <p class="body">And that seems to be all those boxes get checked in this scenario</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean I'm with you you but</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You know? </p>
    <p class="body">I don't know man like I want</p>
    <p class="body">I want the world to be a better place than it was before and it's just there's a real possibility that it won't be</p>
    <p class="body">You know the</p>
    <p class="body">Thing that every civilization is worried about, like when when you talk about the possibility of the advancement of the human race</p>
    <p class="body">The one big dilemma is if we don't blow ourselves up, that comes up all the time whenever people talk about the future, like what is the world going to be like in a million years? </p>
    <p class="body">If we don't blow ourselves up, that's what they always say, like will we get to a point where there is peace and harmony and we no longer have war? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">No more than that</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">No, no more conflict</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">No possible</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Impossible, yeah</p>
    <p class="body">Why just nature of human beings, yeah? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, it's just in nature of human beings, right? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, there's just no chance</p>
    <p class="body">There's no chance of us getting to a place to where there's no war</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, there's too much eh there again, I and I said it earlier</p>
    <p class="body">There's too much money to be made on it, right? </p>
    <p class="body">And and look and think about, yeah, there's too much money to be made on it and and you don't think that Putin likes making money</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I think he thinks</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Do you think that's not? </p>
    <p class="body">A factor you know</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">How much money has? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean he say they say he has ******* untold billions of dollars</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But I just I just don't think that like I, I just don't see</p>
    <p class="body">I don't know</p>
    <p class="body">I mean again again, the last person on this on the face of the planet that needs to be talking military strategy is is probably</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I'm right next to you</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">So, but it's I mean it's it's it's</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">And we're both</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Lasting long yeah is</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It's fun to talk about it but I just I I just don't see I just</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's interesting</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Unless he's suicidal</p>
    <p class="body">I just I don't see</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I would hate</p>
    <p class="body">To have this conversation or go back and listen this conversation a year from now after a nuclear bomb has gone off</p>
    <p class="body">And we're like, wow, we didn't even see it coming</p>
    <p class="body">I'm just saying that</p>
    <p class="body">The the real fear that people have about civilizations</p>
    <p class="body">Not reaching their full potential is natural disasters or self destruction</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Do you ever see and? </p>
    <p class="body">Again I don't know</p>
    <p class="body">I'm just asking a question</p>
    <p class="body">Do you ever see somebody? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, somebody who's willing 'cause, like you know</p>
    <p class="body">You know suicidal</p>
    <p class="body">Sometimes I don't know suicidal people</p>
    <p class="body">They usually just hurt themselves sometimes, right? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean obviously there's</p>
    <p class="body">A difference I don't think</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's just suicidal, it's like</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">What do you? </p>
    <p class="body">Think it is</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You'd want to leave your mark</p>
    <p class="body">Like everyone is afraid of that, that was the the whole plot of that Stephen King book</p>
    <p class="body">The **** was that book</p>
    <p class="body">Uhm, they made into a movie with Christopher Walken the dead zone</p>
    <p class="body">There was a guy who could see the future and he there was a guy who was running for president and he could see that this guy was running for president was going to launch the nukes and that</p>
    <p class="body">Launching those nukes</p>
    <p class="body">Was going to cement their name in the history, which I think for some people is a powerful motivating factor</p>
    <p class="body">Believe it or</p>
    <p class="body">Not especially as you change</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean history gets changed up all the time, so I wouldn't bet</p>
    <p class="body">On that</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, but especially as you're</p>
    <p class="body">Getting older, you know if you</p>
    <p class="body">Like what? What is it? </p>
    <p class="body">What keeps a guy going when you're 69? You've been running Russia for decades and you have untold billions of dollars like what keeps a guy going? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Like what? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, I hope I mean</p>
    <p class="body">I hope that like</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, again, my my friends, my family still being able to</p>
    <p class="body">Gosh enjoy my kids right like enjoy my enjoy my grandkids</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">But you're not a</p>
    <p class="body">Dictator, you know, I think we have to think in terms of like dictators like homicidal dictators</p>
    <p class="body">There's a lot of dictators that they've done, horrific, genocidal things</p>
    <p class="body">They're ruthless, ruthless people</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, but you know if that's the case</p>
    <p class="body">I mean we're going to have to be worrying about Iran</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean, North Korea</p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, like it at the point that that dude gets sick like I mean</p>
    <p class="body">I could see it on</p>
    <p class="body">Like if Putin got diagnosed with a terminal illness</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yes, but that's the thing</p>
    <p class="body">Like what if? </p>
    <p class="body">He has one</p>
    <p class="body">Did you see the podcast that I did with yawn? </p>
    <p class="body">Yawn, mypark? </p>
    <p class="body">She was a woman who escaped North Korea, bro</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Oh, she skipped over there, yeah? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You you listen to her account of what North Korea was like and growing up there</p>
    <p class="body">It's horrific, terrifying, and the the fact this guy has complete control of his population through just complete fear</p>
    <p class="body">They're they're so tiny over there, she was talking to me about how little everybody is, and she's so frail</p>
    <p class="body">She's like when you you like shake her hand like her everything is so small her bones are so small and you realize like she didn't get enough food</p>
    <p class="body">And that's that's why everybody so small</p>
    <p class="body">They're they're ******* starving</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean yeah, how do you? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Fix it, how do you fix it? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, he keeps that population terrified, terrified and under control</p>
    <p class="body">And that's The thing is, it's like that's happening right now in 2022, and one of the things about us is we're so like if someone lives in a wonderful, really safe neighborhood and you just think</p>
    <p class="body">This is the world the world is like my neighborhood</p>
    'cause that's all I experience
</p>
<p class="body">And that's your point of reference</p>
<p class="body">Your point of reference is, is great neighborhood that you live in, where everything is safe and you never really have to worry about anything at the same time, there's places in the world like</p>
<p class="body">What was that there was? </p>
<p class="body">There was</p>
<p class="body">Shane Smith from Vice was telling us about</p>
<p class="body">This one city that has the most murders</p>
<p class="body">I think it was in Pakistan</p>
<p class="body">It's one city where there's more like murders and more hits like you know, like people pay people like it's a shockingly low amount of money to commit murder</p>
<p class="body">And they just have them constantly all the time and</p>
<p class="body">It's just the reality of living there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Karachi was that where it was? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">But we have all these things in America</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">What's the murder capital of the? </p>
<p class="body">World Jamie yeah we</p>
<p class="body">Do, but it's small places right like Southside Chicago</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">When I typed in the city in the world with the most murders, top three were all in Mexico</p>
<p class="body">Whoa, that's now right, yeah, so yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">But you know, we like</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean it's it's</p>
<p class="body">I don't know, I just sometimes I do get frustrated me</p>
<p class="body">I love this country</p>
<p class="body">I mean I, I do believe we're the greatest country on the face of the planet I</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I believe that with</p>
<p class="body">Everything I have, but sometimes we we</p>
<p class="body">I mean we we we do? </p>
<p class="body">We do think we're better, or like we we look at others and and we're kind of doing the same **** sometimes</p>
<p class="body">You know what I mean, like like? </p>
<p class="body">You know, I mean</p>
<p class="body">Just we, you know we</p>
<p class="body">I don't know it's a good for me</p>
<p class="body">Good, good for good for the but not for me</p>
<p class="body">Kind of mentality sometimes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">We were pulling up a chart the other day of the amount of drone strikes that have gone on, while the Ukraine thing is happening that the United States is participating in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">It's pretty ******
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">You know it's pretty ****** like **** There's a lot of drone strikes going on right now</p>
    <p class="body">All over the world, United States participates in</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">So Nat</p>
    'cause 'cause you're thoughtful on this
</p>
<p class="body">So I I wanna I wanna know or you're you're always thoughtful but do you think 'cause I keep hearing this? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think that this issue that's going on in Ukraine? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think it would have happened? </p>
<p class="body">With Donald Trump</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I don't know why it's happening, so I can't answer that</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what Trump would have done differently, like it would just be pure speculation</p>
<p class="body">The people that want to think that Trump was a better leader wanna think that, oh, the Ukraine's wouldn't or the rather the Russians wouldn't **** with Trump? He's he's you know he's he's the only guy that Russia hasn't done any invasions</p>
<p class="body">While during his four years in office, but that</p>
<p class="body">Could just be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Luck, but don't you think it's like, don't you think it's kind of weird and again like I, I wanna make this clear I don't care either way, just like on either one</p>
<p class="body">But don't you think it's kind of weird that like they tried to pin Russia on Trump? </p>
<p class="body">And Biden on Ukraine</p>
<p class="body">Before any of this broke</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Out, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, you know what? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Well, the Russia Trump thing was crazy because</p>
<p class="body">Got into his servers they hacked into, they hired people to hack into their campaign while he was president</p>
<p class="body">They got they hacked into their computers</p>
<p class="body">They planted evidence</p>
<p class="body">They tried to implicate him in the shady dealings with Russia, like it wasn't just that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Who's them? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">They wanted the Clinton campaign</p>
<p class="body">It wasn't just that they were spying on him, it was that they were like, let's Google that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Planting, yeah</p>
<p class="body">And so don't let</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Google what what has been proven about</p>
<p class="body">Who was it? </p>
<p class="body">That it came up with the information</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">And it just came out in like 2 weeks later you got this going on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, very quickly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">And don't you think it's kind of crazy like I mean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
'cause there people weren't upset about it, but that's what's the most ******** like the Democrats weren't freaking out, they weren't saying wait a minute</p>
<p class="body">This is outside of the law</p>
<p class="body">This is a horrific</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">When we look at what we know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Violation of our laws and our boundaries of our ethics</p>
<p class="body">What we think should be done and not done by someone who's a leader</p>
<p class="body">You want to find people who are actually committing crimes, not pin crimes on people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">You know, you just don't think like it's</p>
<p class="body">It's just so weird and I don't know if there's any correlation to it, but I just so weird that like they were trying to plant</p>
<p class="body">Stuff on Trump with Russia</p>
<p class="body">And we know</p>
<p class="body">For a fact</p>
<p class="body">That hunter Biden was taking **** tons of money from Ukraine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Well, as from a company in Ukraine, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Well, of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">There's, but that's the question is like does that company represent the government or is that company just it mean? </p>
<p class="body">Is it just like Chevrolet just a corrupt? </p>
<p class="body">I mean it, not the Chevys corrupt</p>
<p class="body">But you know what I mean just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah no, still shot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Just a company</p>
<p class="body">I mean I don't know</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what was going on there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I don't I either</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I don't know what, but there seems to be for sure some sort of shady dealings going on when he was getting all that money and it doesn't make any sense</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, maybe maybe, maybe it's just a coincidence</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Could be what was the? </p>
<p class="body">Are you looking OK? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">And then it's like you know, you see that and it's just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I think they</p>
******* all talk to foreign lead</p>
<p class="body">They do whatever the **** they can if they think it's gonna help their career, it's going to help their campaign</p>
<p class="body">It's going to help them get over on their rivals</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of that going on, and I think that's one of the reason why Trump ran the 1st place is 'cause he was on the other side of that like he had to pay the Clintons to come to his wedding</p>
<p class="body">You know, it's that</p>
<p class="body">It's that kind of **** yeah, and it was it</p>
<p class="body">His wedding or is it? </p>
<p class="body">Someone else's wedding is what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Is that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">His daughter's</p>

    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Do they? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">What we know about the Durham probe Hillary Clinton's responsibility for the Durham Cloak</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Who's going to have written that unbiased article to find? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't know what do you got anything that's going both ways</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">We're starting to read through that</p>
    <p class="body">So I can if you give me a minute</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I just yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">OK</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean it's just, but I mean it's just it's just I don't know it's just so like when you start looking at it</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">It's dirty like you that is Watergate, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Wasn't that Watergate wasn't wasn't they were spying? </p>
    <p class="body">That was the whole reason why Dick Nixon got out of office 'cause he was ******* spying, yeah? </p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, that's you're not supposed to do that</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">But now it's like I don't know, but it's just like we talked about we talked, we talked about in those relationships like you know you you, you do something and then that all the my gosh I can't believe this happened like it's like the worst thing ever and then it just happens over and over and you kind of just get numb to it right? </p>
    <p class="body">And it's like with with politics</p>
    <p class="body">Now it's like they're I don't know what you could do</p>
    <p class="body">To to get for it to be like Oh my gosh right like you know I mean, Can you imagine if what like Bill Clinton if he got a ******* today in</p>
    <p class="body">The White House would be</p>
    <p class="body">Nothing. He's not getting impeached</p>
    <p class="body">No chance like they would probably raise him up as a</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Hero, yeah they would come up with some reason why you know he</p>
    <p class="body">You know it's just hypersexual individual who is tempted by his genetics and</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">He's not</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">His fault, you know</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">I got one</p>
    <p class="body">One thing that might already be a mistake that's in this</p>
    <p class="body">This was there was a filing that happened last week</p>
    <p class="body">That's gotten this back in the news when the initial spying happened on Trump</p>
    <p class="body">Wasn't it because the Obamas, like Obama, was in office and they were spying on the candidates? </p>
    <p class="body">That's what</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I think that was the original that was the original part, yeah? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">So according to this, the New York Times says that they changed</p>
    <p class="body">That that, like I don't know who they like the Trump team. I guess they were initially saying it was Obama's and now they're saying it was the Clintons team that was doing the spying</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Right, but maybe they thought it was the Obama they knew it was the Democrats, perhaps? </p>
    <p class="body">And then we thought it was the the people that were in power and it turns out it's not the people in power, it was Clinton 'cause she was running against Trump</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean either way</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean, that doesn't necessarily</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">That doesn't make sense though</p>
    'cause you how that means that she is in control, the FBI or wherever is doing that, and she's just a candidate
</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">Well, the general she</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Was a secretary</p>
<p class="body">She wasn't just a candidate, she was she</p>
<p class="body">She wasn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">I don't think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I mean she was a Secretary of State</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">You have to give that up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Though to become the candidate, yeah, but the connections that she had with those people are if she is the favorite to win the president</p>
<p class="body">And the presidency</p>
<p class="body">And she was</p>
<p class="body">The connections that she had with those people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">The only question you gotta ask is in this whole thing is do you? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think Obama knew? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I think he knows everything right, but he also ******* hated the idea of Trump being president</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Wow course like they are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">She, he thought Trump was, you know, a scoundrel</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you remember that ******* White House press conference dinner? </p>
<p class="body">It was kind of hilarious where he says to Trump. I'm one thing you'll never be president, United States like Oh my God, you got it in that guy's craw. That's probably why he became the president</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Oh for sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Probably stuck in his ******* head</p>
<p class="body">He's like I'll show you ************ and you know the thing that scares me is that whether you like Trump or or or hate him, he polarizes the country like he's not a Republican like Ron DeSantis</p>
<p class="body">I think there's a lot of people don't like Ron DeSantis, but it is not</p>
<p class="body">He's not polarizing</p>
<p class="body">The way Trump is, I mean he's still polarizing, but he's not</p>
<p class="body">You don't</p>
<p class="body">People don't ******* hate him</p>
<p class="body">In the same way that they hate</p>
<p class="body">Trump Trump I don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean Trump was exhausting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know</p>
<p class="body">And it's, uh, constantly in arguments and fights with people and going after them and Rosie O'Donnell and girls he banged and all the crazy crazy things to concentrate on</p>
<p class="body">You know, it's like God, man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">The stuff he said</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">You know, Oh my God, it was hilarious</p>
<p class="body">Look if he was</p>
<p class="body">If he wasn't the president and he wasn't a real threat, that's the thing that really ****** him</p>
<p class="body">Because before that the guy was loved</p>
<p class="body">He was crazy and a lot of people hated him</p>
<p class="body">But for the most part he was loved</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean I'll say this like under</p>
<p class="body">Under Trump
    <p class="body">I felt like</p>
    <p class="body">I feel like the country was safe</p>
    <p class="body">Like you know</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I wish I knew that</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Was true, we? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I don't know if it's true or not, but I got felt for me like I felt like</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, I felt like that you know what I, I'll say this, I think just the unknown factor about him made America safer because enemies did not want to even mess</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">With him, well, he's definitely wild</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">The Wild card factor</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Like you said, to look to Kim Jong Un</p>
    <p class="body">We called him little rocket man</p>
    <p class="body">He said we have a nuclear button to our nucleus buttons</p>
    <p class="body">Are way better</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">Here's the other side I</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Guess was to say Pavlich this is the hill</p>
    <p class="body">Katie Pavlich says it was always spying</p>
    <p class="body">So what does this mean here? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">It kind of just goes into the story about what starts at the beginning. I think like April 10th, 2019</p>
    <p class="body">This is what was said</p>
    <p class="body">It goes in</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">OK, here's here's the quote here it says</p>
    <p class="body">For the same reason, we're worried about foreign influence in elections</p>
    <p class="body">We want to make sure that during the elections, I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal</p>
    <p class="body">It's a big deal, Barr testified</p>
    <p class="body">Spying did occur, yes, I think spying did occur</p>
    <p class="body">The question is whether it was predicated adequately predicated</p>
    <p class="body">I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated</p>
    <p class="body">But I need to explore that</p>
    <p class="body">I think it's my obligation</p>
    <p class="body">Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane, and I want to make sure that that happened</p>
    <p class="body">We have a lot of rules about that, but we know that there is a lot of like a lot of the intelligence agencies did not ******* like Trump and he like went to war with those people, which is insane</p>
    <p class="body">It's just ****** We're ****** it's a lot</p>
    <p class="body">Of mess we're</p>
    ****** it's a lot of mess
</p>
<p class="body">It's a</p>
<p class="body">Lot of mess, you know</p>
<p class="body">And then where are we going? </p>
<p class="body">To be in 2024? Excuse me 2024 because he's running again</p>
<p class="body">So here we are 2022. That means 100%. Yeah, I think so, don't you think? So you just announced its</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">You really think he's gonna run again? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Seat back
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I guess</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Just just I mean</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Not nothing surprised does any</p>
    <p class="body">What what would it? </p>
    <p class="body">What would surprise you like tomorrow? </p>
    <p class="body">You wake up? </p>
    <p class="body">What could surprise you at this? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Point it's a good question, yeah? </p>
    <p class="body">That's a good question, everything so aliens</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Would that really surprise you? </p>
    <p class="body">I mean like yes no</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">That would be a surprise</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">You don't think? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I was like wow</p>
    <p class="body">But I mean, I wouldn't even know whether I believe it because like if you really wanted to **** with people, look, I think that a lot of what we're looking at when we're looking at UFO's. And I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I think a lot of it is</p>
    <p class="body">These classified government projects</p>
    <p class="body">I think they have</p>
    <p class="body">They probably have classified propulsion systems that maybe don't even use people</p>
    <p class="body">They're probably just drones, but I think they have capabilities that we don't understand yet in terms of like the general public, and they've been working on these sort of different types of propulsion, magnetic propulsion systems</p>
    <p class="body">These have been theoretical for a long time</p>
    <p class="body">And then this thing that Babolsar supposedly worked on way back in the late 80s at area S4. The way he described it is exactly the way these things are moving the way you know that you see these crafts move like what the one that was observed by Commander David Fravor, the one that was observed by a lot of these other guys that are</p>
    <p class="body">These Air Force folks that are catching these objects moving at these insane rates of speed</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Underwater, yeah</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">They're going from ground to water, from sky to water</p>
    <p class="body">Rather yeah, they don't know what the **** is going on, but if they</p>
    <p class="body">If they're working on these things, it kind of makes sense</p>
    'cause they're always happening like this one
</p>
<p class="body">Here's 1, the phucking one that was in San Diego</p>
<p class="body">Well, why would it be in San Diego? </p>
<p class="body">Well, why wouldn't it be? </p>
<p class="body">That's where the ******* military bases are</p>
<p class="body">There's so much military in San Diego</p>
<p class="body">If you were going to work on some</p>
<p class="body">Top secret classified ****
    <p class="body">You'd have to be near basis, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Wouldn't you? </p>
    <p class="body">You'd wanna do it there</p>
    <p class="body">That's where they would</p>
    <p class="body">Do it</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, I mean I I just yeah I don't know</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Don't know either</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">I mean what if? </p>
    <p class="body">What if, what, what, what if? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't know</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">What if we're all like? </p>
    <p class="body">What if we're all getting played like what if like like? </p>
    <p class="body">What if they? </p>
    <p class="body">What if like? </p>
    <p class="body">What if the aliens are doing all this to us like? </p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I don't think I don't think that's happening</p>
    <p class="body">I think we're too stupid</p>
    <p class="body">I think it's pretty clear that we're doing it to ourselves through corruption</p>
    <p class="body">I mean what we've done in the United States is we have allowed money to get into politics</p>
    <p class="body">We've allowed money to get into</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">It's getting our military</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">Yes yes yes yes</p>
    <p class="body">A lot of it</p>
    <p class="body">I mean, that was what Eisenhower warned about when he was leaving office</p>
    <p class="body">I mean that speech</p>
    <p class="body">When he warns about the dangers of the military industrial complex, that is a terrifying speech because that was a guy</p>
    <p class="body">Who knew you? </p>
    <p class="body">Know he knew exactly what was going on behind the scenes and he chose to take the time when he's leaving office to to warn about a machine that wants</p>
    <p class="body">To go to war</p>
    <p class="body">That wants to find reasons to go to war to profit, and that we know that</p>
    <p class="body">That's real we</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">And that's all we that that that I mean</p>
    <p class="body">That's why we stayed in Afghanistan and Iraq so long</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I'm sure</p>
    <p class="body">I'm sure I had a factor, right? </p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, and then there's people that think we should've stayed there indefinitely</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">You don't think for a second like? </p>
    <p class="body">Yeah, for why like why? </p>
    <p class="body">Like if the Taliban had thought that we were going to come occupy them for 20 years</p>
    <p class="body">They would have gave over Osama bin Laden on September 12th</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Unknown </h4>
    <p class="body">You think so</p>
    <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
    <p class="body">Yeah, they didn't want us there</p>
    <p class="body">You know, I mean like they could have kept going on about business as usual and and you know, I, I just no</p>
    <p class="body">I mean we were there and</p>
    <p class="body">You know, even though this administration completely</p>
    **** this whole pullout up
</p>
<p class="body">Every other administration had the same opportunity to pull us out</p>
<p class="body">But they didn't write and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I think they were warned that this is how it</p>
<p class="body">Was going to go down right, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">And so it's like I'm glad we're out</p>
<p class="body">I'm glad we're out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I mean, it would have been nice if we didn't</p>
<p class="body">Give him all those weapons though, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Well, why do you think we left him there? </p>
'cause then we gotta build more</p>
<p class="body">Oh come on</p>
<p class="body">Come on kidding me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">I didn't</p>
<p class="body">I honestly didn't even think of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">Of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">Guess what all? </p>
<p class="body">All these all these weapon systems, all this military gear</p>
<p class="body">Well now we're just we have to build the next Gen gin 'cause they've got it now, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">It's like a modern version and then Smedley Butler</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">That, but she's mentally Butler</p>
<p class="body">I think he was in he he was a</p>
<p class="body">Medal recipient yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
<p class="body">And it was in the 1930s. I believe. This was after World War One</p>
<p class="body">I think it was 33. He wrote this. It was called war as a racket and this is a guy that</p>
<p class="body">Had served overseas and thought what he was doing like like you could pull it up</p>
<p class="body">Jamie 'cause it's kind of interesting</p>
<p class="body">He was saying that what he thought he was doing was just protecting the world for bankers and different wars or racket</p>
1935 Smedley Butler
<h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
<p class="body">He got two</p>
<p class="body">He got two Medal of honors</p>
<p class="body">You know that dude, he's a ******
    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">But let's
        <p class="body">Give the speech about</p>
        <p class="body">See if you can find</p>
        <p class="body">It's not a long thing to read</p>
        <p class="body">But it it's essentially</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">I'm sure it would be in that Wikipedia at the top</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Yeah it should be</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">If you</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Go down to</p>
        <p class="body">It should be available to read</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>
        <p class="body">Right? </p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
        <p class="body">Oh yeah</p>
        <p class="body">Well, essentially what he said though was that he realized</p>
        <p class="body">Little oh here here it goes perfect</p>
        <p class="body">War is a racket</p>
        <p class="body">It always has been</p>
        <p class="body">It's possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable</p>
        <p class="body">Surely the most vicious it is the only one international in scope</p>
        <p class="body">It is the only one in which profits are reckoned in dollars and losses in lives</p>
        <p class="body">A racket is best described, I believe</p>
        <p class="body">As something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people, only a small inside group knows what it's about</p>
        <p class="body">It's conducted for the benefit of the very few</p>
        <p class="body">At the expense of the very many</p>
        <p class="body">Out of war, a few people make huge fortunes</p>
        <p class="body">Well, he said, I helped make Mexico especially</p>
        <p class="body">Tampico safe for American oil interests. In 1914 I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National Citibank Boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the ****** of half a dozen Central American republics</p>
        <p class="body">For the benefit of Wall Street</p>
        <p class="body">The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1909 to 1912</p>
        <p class="body">Where have I heard? </p>
        <p class="body">Where have I heard that name before I bought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar business? </p>
        <p class="body">Interest rather in 1916 in China I helped see to it that Standard Oil</p>
        <p class="body">Went its way unmolested</p>
        <p class="body">I mean, this is</p>
        <p class="body">He was writing about this in the 1930s, almost 100 years ago</p>
        <h4 class="speaker"> Dakota Meyer </h4>

    <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>
    <p class="body">I think the real problem is, once it's already established the way it is now where there is a lot of financial influence where they do contribute to the campaigns where they do have special interest groups where they do</p>
    <p class="body">Have these people that help them get into office and they're beholden to them once they get in there and then you have people like Nancy Pelosi that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and they make 200</p>
