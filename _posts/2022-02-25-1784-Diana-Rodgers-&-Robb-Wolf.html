<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Hello folks</p>
<p class="body">Good to see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Good to see you</p>
<p class="body">Thanks for</p>
<p class="body">Coming, I'm glad we didn't make it snow</p>
<p class="body">Again, in Texas, it's close</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You almost did</p>
<p class="body">I mean it can snow, it might</p>
<p class="body">Oh, today it's very possible 'cause it was drizzling when I left the house and it was 30 degrees so with</p>
<p class="body">Is not supposed to happen, it's supposed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">To be snow, hopefully it won't be the snow</p>
<p class="body">Apocalypse Part 2</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, last time you were supposed to come, it became a complete disaster, but it was fun</p>
<p class="body">It was fun to watch people slide around and and know that this city has zero infrastructure in terms of like dealing with snow</p>
<p class="body">It's it's kind of 'cause I grew up in</p>
<p class="body">In Massachusetts, where it's you know they know how to handle snow out here, they're they're baffled</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you want to? </p>
<p class="body">She got to tell him what happened with you</p>

<p class="body">Well, well so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">My flight from my I'm from Boston and my flight from Houston to Austin was cancelled so I got the last SUV</p>
<p class="body">You don't know how much I wanted to be on your show. I got the last SUV, drove through the ice storm to Austin, where there was like just dead cars. You know, it was like zombie apocalypse</p>
<p class="body">Got to a Marriott around the corner from here and thought well at least I'll be able to walk if if nothing else in my room overlooked</p>
<p class="body">This on ramp and I just every day for a week with no running water and no bottled water</p>
<p class="body">Watched the cars just slide up and down and then I finally went out to robs house where he at least had a pool for running toilets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Flushing the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But I was living on basically like White claw and canned tuna</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh my God, this was when you were</p>
<p class="body">Supposed to be</p>
<p class="body">Here yeah Oh my God</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Last year 
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I still have a can of wolf chili that she bought here that, but she didn't have a can opener and she was just like I don't know how to get into this thing so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I got it a gas station</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The thing is</p>
<p class="body">It's if you grew up in a place that has winter, like Massachusetts</p>
<p class="body">You're like, this is nothing like guys</p>
<p class="body">This is a normal winter</p>
<p class="body">Day, like what the **** And it it killed this place for a solid week</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's why I still came 'cause I was like they're overreacting</p>
<p class="body">It's just one or two inches of snow, but I didn't realize it was going to be like misting</p>
<p class="body">Nice yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but you know, I mean come on, how much are trucks like? </p>
<p class="body">Take care of this guys</p>
<p class="body">Get some sand like is that that hard? </p>
<p class="body">I mean it happens</p>
<p class="body">It does happen</p>
<p class="body">I mean the idea that you just like shut everything down</p>
<p class="body">For a year</p>
<p class="body">How much does that cost? </p>
<p class="body">Seems like trucks are less expensive than whatever that costs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, and all the poor people that didn't know you can't heat your house with</p>
<p class="body">A stove</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, worse people use grills</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah they used like barbecue grills in their house and they burnt wood and they died</p>
<p class="body">You know, like people got sick</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that was bad news and we were in the process of packing our house to move because we moved March</p>
3rd up to Kalispell</p>
<p class="body">So like all of this, chaos is going on and we didn't know if like the moving truck was getting in and then Diana</p>
<p class="body">Made it to our place and then we weren't sure if she was making it out of there like it was</p>
<p class="body">I mean first world problems, but kind of sketchy first world problems as far as they go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It lets you know that there's a thin veneer of civilization that keeps all the food on the shelves and all the cars moving</p>
<p class="body">And it's not much</p>
<p class="body">It's not much to throw</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It off right, right, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, definitely</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm glad this is a good time to talk about your book</p>
<p class="body">The book is a sacred cow, Diana Rodgers and Rob Wolf</p>
<p class="body">It's available right now</p>
<p class="body">The case for better meat</p>
<p class="body">All I've been eating since January is meat</p>
<p class="body">Oh, I've been eating is meat and and fruit</p>
<p class="body">That's that's my diet</p>
<p class="body">Meat, fruit and eggs</p>
<p class="body">I've never felt better</p>
<p class="body">I've done this before in the past, but I never stuck with it</p>
<p class="body">I would do like that carnivore month of January</p>
<p class="body">I did it like two years ago. I lost Â£12. I looked great, I felt</p>
<p class="body">Great then I started eating</p>
<p class="body">Spaghetti again shocker</p>
<p class="body">I get fat</p>
<p class="body">I get fat and then I my joints hurt again and that's the thing that drives me that it's the most wild</p>
<p class="body">Rather, is my joints feel so good like everything feels better when I'm not eating foods that cause inflammation and for me</p>
<p class="body">There's something. I mean, I'm I'm not advocating this for everybody but a meat based diet for me is 100%, at least in a short term</p>
<p class="body">I've never done it for like years</p>
<p class="body">I know like Shawn Baker and a few of those guys have done it for years and years</p>
<p class="body">Paul saladino</p>
<p class="body">But for me, short term there's nothing that's made me feel better and I can't imagine it would **** me up long term</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I take a lot of vitamins</p>
<p class="body">I do eat a lot of fruit, I'm my exercise</p>
<p class="body">My exercise is great, my I feel healthy</p>
<p class="body">I have plenty of energy</p>
<p class="body">I avoided all the diarrhea 'cause when I just did only meat I had ridiculous</p>
<p class="body">Diarrhea like astounding as my friend Tom Segura put it when he he tried it</p>
<p class="body">He goes</p>
<p class="body">This diarrhea is astounding</p>
<p class="body">I'm like, yes, that's a good way to put it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I was following that and I was like at some point there may need to be an intervention like somebody like dropping you some Imodium or something, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">That sounded rough</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, there's something</p>
<p class="body">About like eating a lot of fatty meat only right? </p>
<p class="body">Right, there's no</p>
<p class="body">Your body is like what is all this? </p>
<p class="body">Where's the veggies like you're you, you always eat veggies</p>
<p class="body">Spaghetti here</p>
<p class="body">Where's where's the bread? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so as a dietitian to be talking about things like this</p>
<p class="body">It's definitely blasphemy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Blasphemy yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean I, I get pushback like crazy from fellow dietitians</p>
<p class="body">It's, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But what do they say? </p>
<p class="body">Well, what's the goal right? </p>
<p class="body">Isn't the goal? </p>
<p class="body">To feel better to look better and to perform better</p>
<p class="body">So if you're eating food that makes you feel better, look better and perform better</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I was at 2:05 when I started this diet. Now I weigh 195 and it's only been two months</p>
<p class="body">And I feel great like I'm not starving, I just lost weight</p>
<p class="body">It just went</p>
<p class="body">It just went away</p>
<p class="body">I got my 6 pack back like I feel better</p>
<p class="body">My joints feel better like I just feel better like isn't that the goal like the whole goal of your diet is supposed to be the vitality of your body, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, and the whole goal of science should be to</p>
<p class="body">Question your bias and seek the truth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I know Sean Baker was telling me that there's a large study that's going on that Harvard is putting on for carnivore diet</p>
<p class="body">Do you, do you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">About that, they have some preliminary data on it, and I mean it, it's there's not</p>
<p class="body">It's not a randomized control trial</p>
<p class="body">There's not a a control group</p>
<p class="body">It it's a survey and so you know it can be very critical of surveys, but it's interesting like 94% of the people that did it got off of the medications that they were on</p>
<p class="body">Like entirely and it went through and detailed like some blood sugar changes</p>
<p class="body">Blood sugars improved dramatically for the vast majority of people they saw lipids improve, not everybody</p>
<p class="body">Some people on kind of a higher fat</p>
<p class="body">Carnivore type diet</p>
<p class="body">They see their lipids go up</p>
<p class="body">And nothing really happened for I don't know 810 years. But then more people started writing about it. More people started talking about it</p>
<p class="body">Now we have randomized control trials and we have all kinds of different interventions, and we have some proof that something like a Mediterranean type diet is probably pretty helpful for a lot of people</p>
<p class="body">So when people criticize this stuff and they just dismiss it out of hand, like, well, there's no research on it</p>
<p class="body">OK, that's fine, but this is where things begin, and it's usually observationally</p>
<p class="body">You know, that? </p>
<p class="body">OK, there's this group of people that seem to be getting these really remarkable results, and the thing that that was so interesting to me</p>
<p class="body">My background was in autoimmunity and Cancer Research and I got into this because of gut and autoimmune issues</p>
<p class="body">I'm the person that came up with the autoimmune paleo diet like I'm the person</p>
<p class="body">That kind of you know, formalize that initially and it works pretty well</p>
<p class="body">But when I saw what people were doing on a carnivore diet it it just blew me away like it</p>
<p class="body">People who had done every other thing and they were so sick they were crippled from gut and autoimmune issues</p>
<p class="body">They would go on this</p>
<p class="body">Modified, you know carnivore type diet and put their their problems into remission and then have really remarkable health at the end of that</p>
<p class="body">And it was a few people initially, but as it has grown, it's become this like really watershed moment and I</p>
<p class="body">I don't think that a carnivore diet is like the first whistle stop somebody should do in dietary change. There's a lot of other **** you could do before that, but if you're really sick, you know I, I think to to both of y'all's points. If you're really sick and you're trying to improve things like it seems like a reasonable thing to use as an intervention</p>
<p class="body">Just it's like playing darts and you're just trying to get closer to the bullseye and you can use that as a beginning point</p>
<p class="body">Some people add in fruit, like Paul Saladino has added in more fruit and honey and stuff like that</p>
<p class="body">Shaun Baker is an absolute beast and he's he wouldn't be caught dead eating fruit, you know, and it just seems to to work for him</p>
<p class="body">But I I think that it's a reasonable place to at least start and begin tinkering with things, and maybe you stick with it long term</p>
<p class="body">Or maybe you modify it down the road</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's got to be a function of different requirements for different people's bodies, right? Different people ask more of their body like a guy like you does</p>
<p class="body">A lot of jujitsu that's very physical</p>
<p class="body">Some people don't</p>
<p class="body">Some people, they just hike and maybe they could have a different diet</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of different things that, uh</p>
<p class="body">Person needs depending on their lifestyle, but when you talk about like a Mediterranean diet specifically, what is what? </p>
<p class="body">What is a Mediterranean diet like what's in there? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's the kind of funny thing</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you've got what the literature kind of says, and then you have what people actually eat and what folks actually eat is a lot of fatty fish</p>
<p class="body">A lot of like lamb and goat and and they definitely eat some legumes</p>
<p class="body">They eat local fruits and vegetables, a lot of olive oil, but it looks very it</p>
<p class="body">It's not this so like grain centric</p>
<p class="body">You know thing that</p>
<p class="body">That is typically portrayed in</p>
<p class="body">Modern dietetics</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So, but is there like a there? </p>
<p class="body">Is there a protocol for the Mediterranean diet? </p>
<p class="body">Like if someone says I'm going on the Mediterranean diet, what do they mean? </p>
<p class="body">Are they eating lettuce? </p>
<p class="body">Do they have vegetables? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Usually Mediterranean diet mean to emphasis on seafood lean meat</p>
<p class="body">Low fat dairy to some degree, legumes as kind of a preponderance for the carbs, like usually in preference to grains, although they'll have some grains in the in the mix too, but that's kind of the</p>
<p class="body">Funny venues, good amount of vegetables</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah olives, olive oil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so it's essentially like a primal diet</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like the idea is just to cut out</p>
<p class="body">Processed foods, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Which is always a good step</p>
<p class="body">One right, absolutely? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but then when you look at what people in the Mediterranean actually ate, it's not</p>
<p class="body">It's a made up diet</p>
<p class="body">It's it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, interesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not really a diet, it's I mean I've been to Spain</p>
<p class="body">They eat a lot of pork and pork is like not OK on a Mediterranean diet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">Why is it not OK? </p>
<p class="body">Isn't it a fatty? </p>
<p class="body">Meat it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, fatty fish is OK but not fatty meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So so you have, you have the what people are actually doing versus kind of what's been canonized within dietetics</p>
<p class="body">And they're really different, and also to Diane's point like what folks are doing in Spain is reasonably different than what they're doing in in Greece and Italy and whatnot. You know, just kind of a granular level, but that just as an aside, the only food</p>
<p class="body">I think that is common to all of the blue zones is pork, but nobody ever mentions that really</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's literally the only food that you know from Costa Rica to</p>
<p class="body">I guess the only one with that that it's not part of would be like the 7th Day Adventist</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But yeah, yeah, that's a weird one, right? </p>
<p class="body">That one is that when people want to lump in all the blue zones</p>
<p class="body">Like they they always like to use Seventh-day Adventist because they're vegetable based, right, right? </p>
<p class="body">But they also no alcohol, no cigarettes, and daily exercise</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and when you compare them to Mormons to have almost identical lifestyle but they eat meat, it's same lifespan</p>
<p class="body">But the Mormons are left out of the blue zones</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Because it didn't fit them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Doesn't fit the narrative</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really, plus they're problematic 'cause they're, you know their whole thing is a little wacky and they get to have a lot of wives</p>
<p class="body">Or they used to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They have the highest meat consumption per capita and the longest lifespans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They like to ignore</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">That one so socioeconomics by far beats diet when you're looking at populations for longevity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Socio economics do so</p>
<p class="body">Even someone with a poor diet but has a lot of money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So they're they're going to have better access to health care</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like Trump</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">That's a good example</p>
<p class="body">He's probably a good example</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean he was 74. He got COVID and he kicked in a few days and he's really</p>
<p class="body">Kind of chubby</p>
<p class="body">He's super chubby, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So be with more money, generally have less stress</p>
<p class="body">They don't work two jobs, they, so there's all these confounding factors when you're looking at these social connections</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Social connections</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And social connections helps</p>
<p class="body">In what way, when? </p>
<p class="body">How do you define? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">This stuff gets a little bit sketchy, but there's, uh, some research that suggests that people with inadequate social connectivity like friends, family</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Public loiners 
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It kind of loners, but you know, they're just socially isolated</p>
<p class="body">That that is as negative on health as a pack a day smoking habit</p>
<p class="body">Now that pack a day smoking habit gets thrown around a lot because people will say eating an egg is equivalent to, like you know, smoking 6 cigarettes or you know something like that, but it but it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's silly nuts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But I think when you think about like</p>
<p class="body">Human evolution and small group environments and stuff like that</p>
<p class="body">There's something really powerful there and it is clearly</p>
<p class="body">You had Sebastian younger on and they they talk about</p>
<p class="body">You know, poorer communities tend to have more social connectivity and you don't see suicides within these groups and whatnot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And there's a lot going on there, but I think that that</p>
<p class="body">That social connectivity in my mind is on par with sleep and food with regards to overall health</p>
<p class="body">Like if you're really negatively impacted there, it's it</p>
<p class="body">It's going to be a major piece of of your overall health, and if you tick that box you can get away with a lot of other stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so so I was listening to a book heartbreak</p>
<p class="body">It's amazing</p>
<p class="body">It's it's this new book out about a woman that got divorced and she's she gets really sick and she's trying to figure out why her health declines and she's kind of going through all the all the numbers and trying to seek it out and talking to these neuroscientists and everything</p>
<p class="body">But loneliness</p>
<p class="body">Your chance of dying early for loneliness is by far beats out cancer or autoimmune diseases</p>
<p class="body">Heart disease</p>
<p class="body">It's loneliness, wow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That makes sense</p>
<p class="body">I mean, people make you feel good, like if you have good friends and you're around them and you're laughing like how? </p>
<p class="body">How is that? </p>
<p class="body">Not good for you, right you? </p>
<p class="body">Know it really should be prescribed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah so</p>
<p class="body">Exercise is critical, but not the primary factor</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I think it provides the quality of life and you know when we think about longevity and kind of healthspan versus lifespan</p>
<p class="body">We want to live as well as we can as long as we can and then very short, you know, decline and and then you know, fade out and I think that's smart</p>
<p class="body">Exercise a base level of cardio, some resistance training</p>
<p class="body">Then just doing a variety of activity</p>
<p class="body">Good mobility that I think that that feeds into the ability to do all the stuff that we want to do and also like</p>
<p class="body">You get sick, you get injured, you get in a car accident or something like people you know</p>
<p class="body">If you're you're better shape, you're just harder to kill</p>
<p class="body">And I think that that</p>
<p class="body">Is such a major factor, but I my opinion you could, you know, maybe agree, but I think when people tackle exercise as a calorie burning endeavor like you're much better</p>
<p class="body">Time spent focusing on good quality food</p>
<p class="body">Very protein centric 'cause it tends to be satiating so you don't overeat so you exercise so you have a ******* life</p>
<p class="body">But if you want to lose weight, good body composition, it's really the nutrition part that that addresses the bulk of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So the people that do exercise just for calorie burn out</p>
<p class="body">But the problem I usually have with that is that I I don't think they enjoy it</p>
<p class="body">I think they think of it as this task that one</p>
<p class="body">Must do in</p>
<p class="body">Order to look better or to justify a Sunday, you know, justify an ice cream sundae or a bowl</p>
<p class="body">You know where it's like you should</p>
<p class="body">You should enjoy the results like you feel good like it's great for the body</p>
<p class="body">It's a stress reliever, it relieves anxiety</p>
<p class="body">It's like</p>
<p class="body">It's so critical if you're going through any like stressful period of your life</p>
<p class="body">That is the time</p>
<p class="body">Well, you gotta be like discipline</p>
<p class="body">With your workouts you gotta hit em</p>
<p class="body">Hard, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's a medicine</p>
<p class="body">That's how I feel</p>
<p class="body">Yeah and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and sarcopenia is something so that's age related muscle loss and we know everyone over 40 starts to lose their ability to digest protein and so your need for protein and your requirement to even just maintain muscle mass goes way up as you get older and the RDA</p>
<p class="body">For protein</p>
<p class="body">Is like so far below</p>
<p class="body">It's set at the minimum to avoid disease</p>
<p class="body">It's not the optimal amount, but even that RDA is way, way, way too low for bridging, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, what is the RDA for? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Protein, so the RDA is .8 grams per kilogram of body weight. But then because Americans don't like kilograms and and they don't want to do the calculations, you'll see these numbers floating around</p>
<p class="body">So for women they'll say women need 45 grams of protein and men need 55 grams of protein or something. But that's based on this</p>
<p class="body">Ideal body weight of 125 for women and 1:50</p>
5 for men</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What do we live in the 30s? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And so yeah, so the average weights according to the CDC for for women is 165, and for men it's like 195</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that real? </p>
<p class="body">The average weight for women is 165</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">For American women, wow, yeah. And so when so then when you go .8 grams per kilogram</p>
<p class="body">You're way above what what these RDA? </p>
<p class="body">Now you're at about double what the RDA is</p>
<p class="body">But then when you look at optimal amounts so we went through this in the book and I looked at all the research and how they came up with the RDA and you know we really need at least double the RDA of protein and we need it from animal source foods is a huge difference</p>
<p class="body">Animal and plant source proteins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now that this is something that vegans their hackles get up immediately</p>
<p class="body">How much real data is there that shows like actual real-world data that shows that plant based protein is not as bioavailable as animal based protein? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, that's just basic biochemistry, it's just a fact</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And what So what is it? </p>
<p class="body">So if you have like 30 grams of broccoli protein versus 30 grams of beef protein, like what is the difference? </p>
<p class="body">What's happening? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, that's a good question</p>
<p class="body">I don't know exactly how like broccoli would compare to beef</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably be a lot a lot</p>
<p class="body">Of mass for broccoli, if you wanted to get 30 grams of broccoli protein like how much broccoli would that be? </p>
<p class="body">A big *** bowl? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Of broccoli, you have your the beans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I do have it for</p>
<p class="body">Uhm, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">For legumes, so let's look at that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">In fact I have</p>
<p class="body">Yeah I have it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah I have it</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if the the Dropbox link that I sent came through</p>
<p class="body">So I've got one comparing beans to beef and I have it for protein for vitamins and for minerals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And for farts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">There's really no comparison</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But and and the other thing is is that's limiting</p>
<p class="body">So here we have</p>
<p class="body">So we don't just need protein, we need amino acids and so and there's a popular meme out there comparing broccoli to steak and how you can get all your protein just from broccoli but but kidney beans are much better source</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So I went with kidney beans and so 4</p>
<p class="body">Ounces of steak versus 4 ounces of kidney beans and when when you see these plant based memes</p>
<p class="body">They will be comparing uncooked beans and they will be doing it by calorie, not by</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, so we need to, you know, look at you know portion size</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And and why are they doing uncooked beans because? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You get</p>
<p class="body">There there's more beans in uncooked beans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, I see 'cause the water is not yeah OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's like double</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's not realistic in terms of portion of food, because you'd cook them and they swell up and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You just and the calories that you would need to eat to get all right</p>
<p class="body">So we have only 9 grams of protein from 4 ounces of kidney beans</p>
<p class="body">So in order to get the same even close to the amount of total protein, you would need to eat</p>
<p class="body">Over three times, the amount of kidney beans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So and that would be, you know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 something calories of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then you need</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Of kidney beans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">To have rice with it as well, to to to balance it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right versus 180 calories of protein from or 180 calories from 30 grams of protein steak</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And you know on that, like sarcopenia side like losing muscle mass as we age and also just for athletics, isoleucine, leucine, some of these branched chain amino acids are are the really important amino acids because they</p>
<p class="body">Stimulate anabolic signaling, and you have a threshold with that</p>
<p class="body">If you don't hit a certain threshold, it doesn't turn on the anabolic signaling, so you're you're tending to lose muscle mass</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of some some broscience like you need to eat every two hours or you're going to lose muscle mass</p>
<p class="body">It's not to that point, but we do need some amount of anabolic signaling exercise</p>
<p class="body">Specifically, strength training causes that anabolic signaling and then eating a protein rich meal</p>
<p class="body">That's that's rich in branched chain amino acids causes that signaling too</p>
<p class="body">And it's it's not impossible to do via plant based methods, but it's hard like it's really kind of a calculus problem</p>
<p class="body">To get that part, that box ticked like you need to do protein powders and stuff like that to usually get in there and and make that happen</p>
<p class="body">But then you also get a ton of calories comparatively</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wouldn't the these simple solution be to if you wanted to have a plant based diet, is to eat the plant based protein but then substitute with exogenous amino acids? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">You could and that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If you did that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And stick more with lagoons and try not to get your protein from like quinoa or peanut butter</p>
<p class="body">Like nuts are a really, actually horrible way to get protein</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We'll get to in a second, but when you're making exogenous amino acids, is it possible to do that in a vegan way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean they can just synthetic chemistry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What are they making amount of? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean then it's, you know it's other chemicals, but you could make it in a bit completely vegan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Friendly way, but it's chemicals, but not bad for you, just chemicals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Weird weird, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Word word right people panic</p>
<p class="body">Right, so you could in fact get all of your amino acids and have some sort of plant based protein</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like what is the optimal plant based protein? </p>
<p class="body">Is it pea protein? </p>
<p class="body">Is it hemp protein like what's the best one? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I would probably say</p>
<p class="body">Pea protein would be optimal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Pete yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But you know, it's it's we're we're meant to eat things in their full form, and so if you were to</p>
<p class="body">Actually eat peas</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a lot of peace</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right and how are they extracting the pea protein? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot of kitchen chemistry</p>
<p class="body">I mean you gotta separate out the the protein, carbs, fat and then isolate the proteins and whether you do a hydroxylated</p>
<p class="body">The proteins like kind of pre digest them or leave it. Leave it together. Usually hydroxylate's taste horrible so</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but I mean in in like an idealized world</p>
<p class="body">If somebody is really</p>
<p class="body">They want to be vegan, but they want to take the boxes of of</p>
<p class="body">Getting that anabolic signaling, preventing sarcopenia, improving you, know body composition</p>
<p class="body">That is a way that you could do it and it would be vegan and it would give the the right amount of protein, not overfeeding you, potentially on the the calorie side, and that could be a way to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Kind of thread the needle so someone's like a vegan weightlifter, right? </p>
<p class="body">And that that's the way they should do it</p>
<p class="body">They should have like pea protein and then substitute with</p>
<p class="body">Supplement rather with amino acid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">With especially with the branched chain amino</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Acids and these are all the ones that you need</p>
<p class="body">Cysteine histidine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Leucine and isoleucine are the main ones, and the and then valeene</p>
<p class="body">But the leucine is the most anabolic signaling of all of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And so if someone wanted to do that, like what, what would you take like? </p>
<p class="body">What's what's a good late deserve a good brand branched chain amino acids</p>
<p class="body">Does brand change when they say branched chain amino acids is that usually contain all these that we're seeing? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">On this chart, not all of them</p>
<p class="body">It'll be leucine, isoleucine, and valine typically</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And so all those other ones</p>
<p class="body">Should you have all those in there like how? </p>
<p class="body">How would one supplement with like a fully? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you look at all this stuff that you're getting from meat, it's crazy</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's so much more like if you wanted to get those benefits</p>
<p class="body">I mean is that what's going on when someone says that meat is not as bioavailable? </p>
<p class="body">Is that part of what's going on? </p>
<p class="body">Is that you're just not getting the same benefit from it because it doesn't have the amino acid profile</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, and this isn't even taking into account bio availability</p>
<p class="body">That's like a whole nother discussion</p>
<p class="body">This is just the label, like the USDA Nutrient database numbers, but that doesn't take into account the protein digestibility score</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So let's let's explain to people that are just listening</p>
<p class="body">We're looking at this chart and it shows the sirloin steak on the left and the kidney beans on the right</p>
<p class="body">And the amount of amino acids is in most cases four or five times more, if not more than that from the steak</p>
<p class="body">Then you're getting from the beans</p>
<p class="body">The beans have a similar calories, but only 9 grams of protein versus 30 grams of protein for the steak</p>
<p class="body">So this is what we're looking at</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then I have this broken out also for minerals and for vitamins just so the micronutrients that you're getting from animal source foods too, which are far superior to</p>
<p class="body">So here we have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Vitamins right? </p>
<p class="body">But this is just beans right? </p>
<p class="body">Which are not really known as primary sources of vitamins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They're touted as the magic food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Beans for vitamins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">For for nutrient density</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not for vitamin A since they have 0%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But this is the</p>
<p class="body">This is kind of the cul-de-sac you get stuck into though, like how do you get enough protein? </p>
<p class="body">How do you not overeat and then what type of nutrient deficiencies are you facing at the end of that? </p>
<p class="body">Like it it it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, if you</p>
<p class="body">Look, it's funny that they put vitamin D 'cause you don't really don't get vitamin D from food on both of them have zero percent like why is that on there then? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's just part of the USDA</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, I see. And vitamin A again. It's like you know we get 1% from steak, but the big ones are vitamin B12</p>
<p class="body">That's a big one, 'cause if you look at big the the big difference in B12 in kidney beans you have zero percent B12 and steak. You have 95% of your USD and that's just for 4 ounces</p>
<p class="body">There's a small portion of sirloin steak, and you're getting almost a full daily requirement of vitamin B12, which that is a big factor with people that are on a plant based diet is getting their their B12</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and we iron and B12 or two of the most common nutrient deficiencies worldwide</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And both of those are common in meat and not very common in in plant based stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Stuff, yeah, and whenever there is a nutrient in both plants and animals, our bodies prefer the animal source nutrients</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Why is that and how do we? </p>
<p class="body">Know that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So for</p>
<p class="body">Like example beta carotene, which is like what makes sweet potatoes, orange and carrots orange</p>
<p class="body">We have to convert that to vitamin A retinol, which is the usable form</p>
<p class="body">So when we eat an animal source of vitamin A which is in fats of animals</p>
<p class="body">We're getting it directly and there's about 45% of the population has a gene that makes it so they can't make that conversion efficiently</p>
<p class="body">So not only do we have to convert it, but then almost half of all humans can't do it very well, and so to convert</p>
<p class="body">Beta carotene to vitamin A and that's just one you know</p>
<p class="body">Heme iron in animals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Half of the people that can't</p>
<p class="body">Is it because of the location of their ancestors is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It that's my guess, because what we see with Omega Threes is people that you know lived along coast where they were getting their Omega threes from fish</p>
<p class="body">Lack the ability to efficiently convert plant source</p>
<p class="body">Essential fatty acids to the ones that we actually need for our bodies to use</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Very interesting</p>
<p class="body">And so, how would one know? </p>
<p class="body">How would one find out if there that may mean maybe some people could digest sweet potatoes really easily? </p>
<p class="body">Some people can't like what</p>
<p class="body">How do I know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Some genetic testing can ferret some of that out, but now that we have people that come from so many different backgrounds it it can be challenging and the genetic testing isn't isn't perfect on that</p>
<p class="body">You know you can find it</p>
<p class="body">Maybe you have a high likelihood of converting the the carotenoids into retinol</p>
<p class="body">But then some some of these nutrient issues are gut related, so if your gut microbiome is deficient in</p>
<p class="body">Some type of of bacteria you may not even get that the the conversion to be able to get the the beta carotene into your body, so that's another layer to it</p>
<p class="body">It just gets really complex</p>
<p class="body">Like I, I think you almost go the simpler way of instead of trying to get in and and get super detailed on like the genetics</p>
<p class="body">How do you look? </p>
<p class="body">How do you feel? </p>
<p class="body">How do you perform? </p>
<p class="body">Keep kind of an inventory of what you're reading, and then if we if there are some pretty classic nutrient deficiency syndromes, you know like dry skin and split nails and things like that for for zinc deficiency as an example, and so it's almost easier to go that way versus trying to get in and then from like first principles</p>
<p class="body">Figure out</p>
<p class="body">What's your genetics and what's the perfect diet that's going to work for you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so the bio availability</p>
<p class="body">What do we know in terms of the bio availability of the print? </p>
<p class="body">The plant based proteins versus animal based proteins like how do we know that the body? </p>
<p class="body">Is absorbing the protein more efficiently from an animal source? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm trying to pull up the UM</p>
<p class="body">The protein bioavailability chart 'cause there is a chart that sets it and it's animal source proteins are always above plant source proteins 100%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Mechanistically, what they do is they'll figure out a given amount of protein, and then they've fed that to people, and then they will look at serum amino acid levels</p>
<p class="body">After that kind of track them over time so and will based proteins</p>
<p class="body">You're going to let's say you give them 30 grams of protein and then you track over a 2 hour period</p>
<p class="body">The branch all the amino acids that we that we see go up and then down during that and you can compare that to beans or broccoli and and so that that is a piece of how you figure out the the comparative bioavailability of 1 protein versus another</p>
<p class="body">And you see this even just with like cooked proteins versus non cooked proteins like</p>
<p class="body">Could I know that there's kind of? </p>
<p class="body">I like eating some like steak tartar here and there and stuff like that, but there's just kind of a reality that meat that is cooked is much more bioavailable</p>
<p class="body">For the proteins and also the nutrients that are in it versus raw meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's interesting, like what about rare? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm not sure on that because it's still cooked some, so I'm not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's cooked on the outside, but the inside is pretty</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's cooked on the outside</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't</p>
<p class="body">I suspect that you're you know, like if you were to suivi something and slow cook it</p>
<p class="body">And in it's cooked thoroughly</p>
<p class="body">I think that it would</p>
<p class="body">That would probably optimize, like the bioavailability of the the whole protein, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What about the difference between like a medium, rare and a well done is well done, less bioavailable or more? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I think that well done</p>
<p class="body">It's probably more bioavailable, but it, but it tastes so bad that what's</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I thought about that it's a really good question</p>
<p class="body">I I don't know for sure, but</p>
<p class="body">If you only eat a tiny piece of it because it tastes horrible, then I don't know if it's really help you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Because I'm always wondered, like, particularly because of game meat, 'cause wild game meat is always being touted as being much more protein rich than domestic cattle</p>
<p class="body">And I I eat a lot of that stuff, so I'm always wondering like what is going on, how? </p>
<p class="body">Do they know it's definitely lean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So I mean you're getting a lot of protein per serving because the game meat is so incredibly lean</p>
<p class="body">So when you compare it</p>
<p class="body">Per calorie, or even if you've just got, you know, four or five oz on a scale. If you have like a rib eye, what is a rib eye like? 20% fat by weight? Something like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I think it's more 45%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's 45 by calories. Or is it 45? </p>
<p class="body">Percent by weight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, so so</p>
<p class="body">There's no carbs in meat, so all you have is protein fat</p>
<p class="body">So if you're looking for like what has more protein like boneless skinless chicken breast can have more protein than a burger only because</p>
<p class="body">As less fat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But it also has less nutrients overall because the a lot of the, like the fat soluble vitamins, the EA, not really DK is is all in the the fact</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's one of the benefits of eating at least some amount of animal fat, because those fat soluble vitamins kind of associate with that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">About the difference between a red meat and a white meat like a chicken versus like a you know grass fed steak</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Beef is about</p>
30% more nutrient dense than chicken</p>
<p class="body">Per calorie and chicken is really high in Omega 6 is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Really interesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Like really high the inflammatory no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that good? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">The inflammatory fats so you know, we're we're a lot of people think chicken is more</p>
<p class="body">Virtuous to eat for some reason</p>
<p class="body">But it it's yeah like like you, you know there, you'll see like everyone who has these like clean eating books that are eliminating meat, but they'll still have boneless skinless chicken breast in there of course, and it's more like almost more like tofu of meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Virtuous is that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You know it's not</p>
<p class="body">A bone like white and you know</p>
<p class="body">Kind of clean looking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Plus, chickens do a little heartless dinosaurs</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know people don't really, you know cows you could pet them and stuff chickens</p>
<p class="body">Just trying to figure out if they can</p>
<p class="body">Eat you and they will</p>
<p class="body">If they could? Oh dude, I used to have chickens and they pecked at my daughter's feet. And my wife was like she thinks that the hand</p>
<p class="body">Thinks our daughter's foot was a mouse or a warm something. Oh no, she's trying to eat her daughter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like what do you think? </p>
<p class="body">She's just dumb</p>
<p class="body">This is a dumb little marble ********* head</p>
<p class="body">He's trying to eat our kid like like that's how I thought about that chicken</p>
<p class="body">I'm like FCK off you little **** like ****** birds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So I always tell people like if you're in a grocery store and you don't have access to, you know, know your farmer or grass fed beef and you're just looking at pork, chicken or beef</p>
<p class="body">From a nutrient density from an animal welfare and from an environmental perspective, actually beef is going to be the better choice when you're looking at the industrial food system model</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's OK, so this is where we get into the weeds, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because when you say that in any way that beef or raising beef is good for the environment in any way, shape or form, that's when people go nonsense</p>
<p class="body">The doctrine as stated upon high is that if we want to save the environment, we have to</p>
<p class="body">Eat less meat</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I hear this from people with no evidence</p>
<p class="body">I hear it from people and they spouted out and I go</p>
<p class="body">What are you saying? </p>
<p class="body">Well, you should know already, they'll they'll give you that</p>
<p class="body">You should know already that if you're eating a lot of meat, it's bad for the environment</p>
<p class="body">Like how's it bad? </p>
<p class="body">Tell me how it's bad, what's going on and they'll bring up factory farming</p>
<p class="body">I'm like, well, factory farming is horrible, it's horrible</p>
<p class="body">Everybody, everybody says</p>
<p class="body">Disgusting, but what about regenerative farming and they're like, well, that's not sustainable</p>
<p class="body">That doesn't work</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Or we don't have the</p>
<p class="body">Land for</p>
<p class="body">It right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And this is where sometimes I think that we chose to do the book and film because we wanted to commit career suicide and public public self immolation both at the same time</p>
<p class="body">Because it's like we</p>
<p class="body">This thing ended up ******* everybody off because we don't</p>
<p class="body">We're not totally in the like whitewashed regenerative AG camp like we</p>
<p class="body">We see some laudable features, two pieces of like the industrial system and some of the meat that we brought you is from a local outfit that mainly pasture feeds there</p>
<p class="body">They're meat, but when they were, they were in a drought situation and so they reached out to some of the local breweries and they got</p>
<p class="body">A bunch of</p>
<p class="body">You know, residue from the brewing process and that's what they supplemented their animals with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Some kind of barley grain, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And and that's a whole other interesting thing</p>
<p class="body">Is the bulk of the the food that is given to cattle comes out of the ethanol industry</p>
<p class="body">It we're not stealing food from humans to to do that with chickens and pork, you kind of are allocating food that could have otherwise</p>
<p class="body">On to humans, but even conventional beef spent 70% of its life on grass and then that finishing process, oftentimes part of the finishing process</p>
<p class="body">They put it in a wheat field where the the wheats been harvested and then it it eats the crop residues and it's eating</p>
<p class="body">You know the the mash from</p>
<p class="body">You know industrial or or</p>
<p class="body">You know, drinkable ethanol production, so there's a whole interesting nutrient upcycling story there that just gets buried, and it's really important, and it's really valuable to very efficient, but it doesn't really fit into either camp, it it isn't this beautiful view that that we would like all these</p>
<p class="body">You know grass fed</p>
<p class="body">Pasture raised, you know, stories to fit into, and it's definitely not the horrors of like industrial chicken production, which is super gnarly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Super gnarly what is drinkable ethanol? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Beer, wine, you know</p>
<p class="body">Just just the stuff because you have industrial ethanol and then you have the stuff for it, but a lot for for you know, beer, wine, spirits, all that type of stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Or even oatly they got into trouble from some of their followers because the hulls from the oats were going to feed pigs</p>
<p class="body">And Oatly is a is a oat milk company</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is oatly? </p>
<p class="body">OK, I hate when they say that oat milk like not does not come out of oat breast</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oat water 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Stop it, you stop</p>
<p class="body">It with the milk</p>
<p class="body">You know that's not milk, it's just you're doing weird **** with water, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know it's not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Milk it's oat T</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, that's that's good</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, call it oat white OT yeah</p>
<p class="body">Or almond T</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but but there's a lot of leftovers from their processing, so they were feeding pigs with it, which is an awesome use of that</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But the vegans found out and put the kabash on it, and now they're trying to form oat bars for humans</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh God residue</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Out of this inedible fiber that exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh Jesus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And so, but the you know with cattle because they're ruminants, they their digestive system is very different than a pig or a chicken</p>
<p class="body">And a cow can actually can upcycle stuff that has no other use in our food system is just going to sit in a pile and emit greenhouse gases anyway if we don't feed it to cows and so they can actually eat</p>
<p class="body">Stuff we can't eat and turn it into beef</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Interesting, so that's the the grain that's left over the mash that's leftover from the breweries, and that's this oat stuff</p>
<p class="body">And so the the vegans got upset and was they were upset because they were bringing it to people that were giving this stuff to pigs that were going to be led to slaughter</p>
<p class="body">Wow, is there a way to like? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, it seems like it's silly to just not use it</p>
<p class="body">I mean, you know the Earth uses it, right? </p>
<p class="body">If it does biodegrade, it's going to compost and it's going to</p>
<p class="body">Have some sort of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">A function for days, but when you're dealing with industrial levels of that, like in in Brazil, there's a problem with the banana peels 'cause the banana peels are actually</p>

<p class="body">It it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Pretty toxic and it's hard to figure out how to how to deal with those things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wait a minute</p>
<p class="body">How are banana peels toxic? </p>
<p class="body">When I watch so many people on Tik T.O.K make shredded pork out of banana peels? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">If they really get after it, they're going to have a a rough day</p>
<p class="body">They're going to **** themselves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Have you ever seen that ever? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, yeah</p>

<p class="body">Seen him do that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's not edible, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like what are they doing? </p>
<p class="body">They're basically like spicing up garbage</p>
<p class="body">And trying to serve it as pulled pork? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that is so weird when they do that</p>
<p class="body">Does Shawn Baker videos where he's sitting there have you haven't seen his? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And he's just horrified</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Shaun Baker has a giant cutting board and literally like a machete, and he's just slicing into beef and he's eating this like 4 pound rib eye</p>
<p class="body">And while he's cutting into beef</p>
<p class="body">On the other side of the screen you see someone making like tofu ribs</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, here it is, yeah</p>

<p class="body">Look at him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's some of the best performance art on the Internet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, like the size that ******* tape</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I do love the size of that night</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The the knife is so preposterous he's just taking big slices of meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, and here's the banana peel</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And so they're taking this banana peel and they scrape off the stuff on the inside</p>
<p class="body">So he's eating pork too, and so he's eating real pork while they're eating this stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Hey court</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's like what what is in a banana peel</p>
<p class="body">I mean what is it? </p>
<p class="body">Just plant fiber there's or any nutrients at all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean technically there would be some nutrients, but what it has is the anti predation chemicals to keep things from eating the banana</p>
<p class="body">So it has these, uh, I don't know if it's opponents, and I think it's opponents kind of a soap like substance, but it will really irritate and damage the gut lining like they try to feed it to cattle and even cattle that are really good at eating kind of squirrely</p>
<p class="body">Things it will make the cattle sick</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's just the outside though</p>
<p class="body">Why doesn't the inside have those things? </p>
<p class="body">The inside of banana? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">That even that stuff that she's scraping out has some of that in it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But the banana itself doesn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Too, yeah</p>
<p class="body">The banana doesn't</p>
<p class="body">I interesting, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">That's why fruit is</p>
<p class="body">Doing well for you right now</p>
<p class="body">So fruit wants you to eat it because it wants you to deposit the seeds somewhere</p>
<p class="body">Else, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It wants you to pull it out and so the seeds will be fertilized and then they'll grow somewhere else</p>
<p class="body">That's the it's whole strategy plan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">That's his</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's the thought process behind way</p>
<p class="body">Paul Saladino describes his</p>
<p class="body">You know he's he calls himself Carnivore MD</p>
<p class="body">And basically he's got a meat based diet</p>
<p class="body">But he supplements it with fruit</p>
<p class="body">And this is the first time I've ever tried to do it that way, and it's so much easier to do right than just eat meat and it just</p>
<p class="body">It's great because before workouts like today, I had two bananas and then I worked out like if no problem exercising, whereas I was when I was just eating meat</p>
<p class="body">I was a little draggy, like when I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Was working out and I love meat but the only time of my life like I've eaten kind of a ketogenic diet for</p>
23 years, but there are some some a little bit of fruits and vegetables, some different things in there, and the only time that I had like neurotic food desires was when I was doing like strict carnivore like</p>
<p class="body">And I wanted pizza and ice cream and **** that I never wanted before</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Like I I went kind of crazy</p>
<p class="body">Whereas like</p>
<p class="body">Loosening it up and having a little bit of fruit a little bit of honey here and there, particularly for you know pre or post workout or something</p>
<p class="body">Like I'm I'm fine with that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you think that's what is that process of converting the meat to sugar gluconeogenesis? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think that that's what that is? </p>
<p class="body">It's like your body, like cranking it up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's an expensive</p>
<p class="body">Process, it's a hard process to do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Could be that could have been</p>
<p class="body">I was just nuts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You're I mean</p>
<p class="body">Rob and I are already really restricted with our diets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">We both have celiac, so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is Cecilia can't have any wheat, can't have any</p>
<p class="body">What it what it? </p>
<p class="body">What is the bulk of the restrictions? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean everything on the inside of the grocery store is just completely or even going to a Taco place</p>
<p class="body">And if they fried the corn tortilla on the same griddle as the flower one, I would have reaction</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's celiac, has an autoimmune gluten sensitivity so the villi the little finger like things that line the gut that help absorb nutrients</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Those just get killed via an autoimmune reaction because the body is</p>
<p class="body">It's made antibodies against proteins in our body by mistakenly making them against the the gluten gliadin proteins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But how many people have this and don't know about it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I know that</p>
<p class="body">They they think it's one in a</p>
133 
<p class="body">People have it</p>
<p class="body">Wow, it took me until I was 26 to find out that I had it I</p>
<p class="body">Had it my whole life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And you were just eating pizza and going off</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And being very sick</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, interesting so</p>
<p class="body">So there's the celiac thing and this requires you to stay away from all glutens</p>
<p class="body">Is there anything else that it requires you to stay away from? </p>
<p class="body">Are you allow? </p>
<p class="body">Is are nuts OK? </p>
<p class="body">Like peanuts, walnuts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, I definitely feel better when I eat a diet more close to what you described</p>
<p class="body">But yeah, strictly meat was a little intense for me</p>
<p class="body">Although you know I wanted to mention I had a nutrition client who with</p>
<p class="body">Compulsive overeating 
<p class="body">And so, and I've sat through these</p>
<p class="body">They're like AA meetings, but for people that are compulsive overeaters, so like their reward signals just light up</p>
<p class="body">Times a million in their rain when they when they encounter certain foods</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really, what is that? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean that you know, I think some people just are prone to addiction</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it? </p>
<p class="body">Psychological thing? </p>
<p class="body">Or is it? </p>
<p class="body">Is there like a sync like is there a thing you could track in the brain when they're overeating like this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean my theory on this is that</p>
<p class="body">Some people are just low dopamine and they may get into heroin</p>
<p class="body">They may get into gambling or they may become compulsive overeaters, and it's just sort</p>
<p class="body">Of how it plays out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, like some of my clients they</p>
<p class="body">Do all of the above</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Or or or all of them</p>
<p class="body">But so I sat in on a meeting when I was a Dietetic student and 
<p class="body">They all have to identify their trigger food and then agree to not eat it and abstain from it</p>
<p class="body">So sort of like an alcoholic type meaning except for unfortunately for them you have to eat</p>
<p class="body">You can't avoid eating, you know</p>
<p class="body">And it was white foods that was</p>
<p class="body">Unanimously, the trigger food for, like all these people, but it's still can be overwhelming to figure out what you're going to eat</p>
<p class="body">And so anyway, I had a young woman who she just wanted to go carnivore</p>
<p class="body">It was easier for her to like</p>
<p class="body">Just give herself only that and she lost and she had rheumatoid arthritis that went into remission</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">She lost</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Gosh like 60. It's still going actually. I think the last time I checked was 60 or 75 pounds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And her arthritis went into remission</p>
<p class="body">Yes, So what do we think is happening to people guts? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think that it's the plant defense chemicals that are messing with people? </p>
's guts, do you think with when it comes to, obviously not celiacs, which is an extreme version, but when people do have issues with autoimmune issues that are food related? </p>
<p class="body">But it what is causing this stuff? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I, I think there's a lot like we have now. You know, antibiotics were developed in the 1930s like the sulfa based antibiotics and it was 1950s ish that the more penicillin derived antibiotics started hitting</p>
<p class="body">So how many generations now do we have, like mom, to baby, mom to baby like alterations, potentially in the gut microbiome? </p>
<p class="body">So some people who have the celiac gene don't express celiac disease because they have gut microbes that that trim up the Prolia lendo peptidase</p>
<p class="body">It it the Prolia Linda peptidase bacteria that break up the the gluten proteins</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that something someone could supplement with? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Kind of, but it doesn't work that well, like it it</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of like, uh, it will protect you from like cross contamination a little bit, but like you get so sick with celiac, it it? </p>
<p class="body">It's something that I would be careful</p>
<p class="body">You know, playing around with that, but you know</p>
<p class="body">So you've got antibiotics</p>
<p class="body">You have alterations in in just our environment</p>
<p class="body">I think that there's gut issues, mitochondrial issues and then changes in our food supply, so I think it's a lot of different things</p>
<p class="body">Low vitamin D levels like the autoimmune diseases track very, very closely with</p>
<p class="body">Latitude you tend to see relatively little autoimmune disease near the equator and then you see it much higher at higher latitudes, so vitamin D is a big factor, so there's a lot of different things that go into it, which is a little bit of the problem of trying to figure out how to fix it, because doctors have a tendency to just say that people are crazy or it's mainly in their head because there's like this piece and that piece and the other piece</p>
<p class="body">There's clearly a piece to a loss of gut barrier function like that's pretty well understood</p>
<p class="body">Alessio Fasano like he he's a researcher mainly looking at celiac disease, but he has celiac disease as a model for autoimmune disease in general, but there's a loss of intestinal barrier function when intact food particles can make it</p>
<p class="body">Into the body, then the body can mount immune responses to everything, and then the flip side of this</p>
<p class="body">And maybe why Carnivore works so well is it if somebody eats a very simple diet, it doesn't irritate the gut</p>
<p class="body">The gut can heal and then the body is not primed to be, you know, reacting as as much doesn't mount the same immune response and so you can kind of dial that</p>
<p class="body">That inflammatory process down</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">There's there's also other people that think that you know when you live in a really clean environment and you're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, the hygiene hypothesis</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so so all of us have immune systems that want to be working and and exercising themselves all the time</p>
<p class="body">And in places where you're more likely to have parasites or you know other pathogens through your food</p>
<p class="body">Your immune system is busy working on all that stuff and and keeping you healthy</p>
<p class="body">But when you are living in a place where there's just not anything for your immune system to work on, then it'll work on you and start attacking yourself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How much do you buy into this idea that plants, whether it's like kale or whatever they these plant defense chemicals that these plants emit are causing some autoimmune issues with people? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">For sure they they are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">For sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">In some people it shouldn't really be that way though, not to the degree that we we see now</p>
<p class="body">And this is where just looking back at Lake</p>
<p class="body">The 1950s, you know, people weren't celiac existed then, but it didn't exist to the degree it does now</p>
<p class="body">You didn't see these multiple chemical sensitivities that that folks have now</p>
<p class="body">Plant defense mechanisms are definitely there</p>
<p class="body">I mean, part of the reason why people soak sprout and ferment grains and legumes is that it? </p>
<p class="body">Decrease it's those things, so within most traditional food cultures there's ways of taking relatively toxic food to making them less toxic, like wait, what do they do with the Taro root to to get the cyanide out of it? </p>
<p class="body">I mean just cooking, but they will also prevent it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, that's a big process</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, but yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Even with corn and lime</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, corn and lime, isn't it</p>
<p class="body">So there's a lot of historical food systems that</p>
<p class="body">That help deal with this stuff, but it it just when you look at most traditional food systems, it took pretty good care of people like not everybody on the planet need to eat Paleo to to have really outstanding health</p>
<p class="body">You know traditional meso American food</p>
<p class="body">Even though it was very corn rich, they they figured out that you needed to</p>
<p class="body">To do some things to</p>
<p class="body">Prevent pellagra, which is this B vitamin deficiency ultimately, which was the inclusion of lime but</p>
<p class="body">There's something that's changed where we are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The inclusion of line, what do you mean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">The the the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">When you make corn tortillas, traditionally you you like ferment it with lime and that breaks down some of the anti nutrients</p>
<p class="body">With the corn it makes it more digestible</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, I see yeah yeah</p>
<p class="body">So this is when they're making the tortilla</p>
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<p class="body">So what about the difference between a cooked vegetable versus a raw vegetable? </p>
<p class="body">Because one of the things that people love to</p>
<p class="body">Say is like, oh</p>
<p class="body">I only eat raw</p>
<p class="body">Vegetables and I'm like hey man, I don't think that's good</p>
<p class="body">I used to think that was good</p>
<p class="body">But I don't think that's good anymore</p>

<p class="body">You're right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Period, I mean it's just really hard to digest them</p>
<p class="body">And I mean when you look back at traditional cultures pre agriculture</p>
<p class="body">What you ate when you could get that and then all the other stuff was what you ate when you couldn't get the meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He stated to survive</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just to give you some calories</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but meat meat is the most nutrient dense, perfect food for humans</p>
<p class="body">It just is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's such an exhausting conversation when you say that to people though</p>
<p class="body">Like you said, I think you know you're eating all that meat</p>
<p class="body">Like what about your cholesterol? </p>
<p class="body">What about you gotta have a heart attack? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and it's working its way into policy, which is really disturbing to me</p>
<p class="body">Like as a mother like New York City public Schools vegan on Fridays</p>
<p class="body">Now, in addition to Meatless Mondays</p>
<p class="body">So now you've got</p>
<p class="body">A school system where 70% of the kids are economically disadvantaged</p>
<p class="body">And might go home on the weekends like they need school lunch, right? </p>
<p class="body">And now you're, you're you're flanking the weekends with nutrient poor both Friday and Monday</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's this ideologically driven thing that's based on this idea that if you eat less meat, it's better for the environment like this thing that they say</p>
<p class="body">And they also say, for health purposes like, oh, they'll, they'll, they'll cite the China study like this one ******* study and like, no matter how much you say like hey, you need to read the rebuttals of the China study because they're pretty brutal and it's it shows that it's a lot of biased evidence and that they really didn't do a good job of being objective about that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So there's one thing that's that's coming up that's happening right now. That's really interesting, so there's this thing called the global burden of disease, and this is published by The Lancet, and it's what most global food policy is set on. And between their report in 2017 and 2019</p>
<p class="body">Meat was 36 times more likely to kill you</p>
<p class="body">And there were some researchers, some friends of mine that pushed back they wrote a letter to The Lancet which was blocked</p>
<p class="body">Blancett, it sounds like it's finally going to be publishing it like over the next couple days</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Finally, publishing this thing that says that meet us</p>
36 more times</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh no, that's out the 2019 global burden of disease is out, and I actually had a, uh, a graphic on that, just to show</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's how</p>
<p class="body">What are you saying is going to be published? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So some friends of mine right? </p>
<p class="body">Because these guys didn't provide any evidence at all</p>
<p class="body">As to why meat, so there's this theoretical minimum risk exposure level that you know is supposed to be the safe level of meat you can eat, and it went down to 0</p>
<p class="body">According to these researchers, which is going to be global food policy? </p>
<p class="body">You can now eat 0 red meat safely with no so that they said they did their own systematic review, but they were</p>
<p class="body">They didn't show any of the evidence any of the papers they reviewed, and there aren't</p>
<p class="body">There's no research that's strong that's showing</p>
<p class="body">Meat is, there's only one randomized control trial</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If they're not showing you evidence, any evidence, they're not not showing any papers</p>
<p class="body">How is this? </p>
<p class="body">How is this science? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, and so finally The Lancet is going to publish this paper where my colleagues are questioning</p>
<p class="body">The results and where is the science and the land set? </p>
<p class="body">I mean the global burden of disease is the land set</p>
<p class="body">This is a really</p>
<p class="body">Very big deal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So I don't understand like what is there I I always thought that with scientific papers you had to cite sources and you had to so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Up until about two years ago, that was pretty consistent, and then I think we've seen a loosening of standards</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, here's the difference. Between 2017 and 2019, so you can see the top part is what we're doing in excess and you can see that diets high in red meat used to be a very small percentage of like the cause of death globally</p>
<p class="body">Which is even a silly thing, but it was it used to be. Sodium was much higher, and now meat has gone up. Do you see this 36 times more likely to be the cause of death? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How's that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">In two years</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So this is the study</p>
<p class="body">This is and this analysis when when they're doing this, how are they coming to this conclusion? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Nobody knows</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Nobody knows there, they're just saying it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They just tell you they're just saying it</p>
<p class="body">So what is their motivation? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">We don't really know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean a little tinfoil hat YII think that there's a powerful desire to consolidate food production globally and</p>
<p class="body">This is an amazing way to do it it it's</p>
<p class="body">The as it is, there's I think that six or seven companies produce like 90% of the food that's consumed globally. But what we've seen over time is just more consolidation, more consolidation, and</p>
<p class="body">There's this kind of weird interface between tech and venture capital and food</p>
<p class="body">There's been some interesting pieces where folks are looking at food like they want it to be operated, like IP, like software</p>
<p class="body">They want you to be able to own the intellectual property around it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's interesting you say that because Bill Gates is now the largest owner of farmland in the United States</p>
<p class="body">We looked at that up once there was some sort of dispute about that, but then we looked at</p>
<p class="body">It said he was right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">He wants to be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">He seems a lot, but it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That way, shitload, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">He's the gates</p>
<p class="body">Gates Foundation is one of the major sponsors of this study that I was just talking about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so it's ******* so and but The thing is, he keeps saying that we've got to eat less meat</p>
<p class="body">And you know, we've got to cut our consumption of meat out to be healthy</p>
<p class="body">And then we're going to get used to these meat alternatives when a guy like that says that I'm like, are you making money because of this? </p>
<p class="body">Like why are you saying that? </p>
<p class="body">And by the way you look like **** 
<p class="body">Like 'cause if you're eating those those plant based burgers or whatever the **** you're doing, like you're obese like a guy like that telling people about he's got these breasts in this this gut and I'm like this is crazy</p>
<p class="body">You're one of the richest guys on Earth</p>
<p class="body">You have access to the best nutrients</p>
<p class="body">The best you could have on an amazing trainer</p>
<p class="body">You could be in phenomenal shape and you're giving out public health advice</p>
<p class="body">You're giving out health advice and you're sick</p>
<p class="body">It's like literally like a non athlete trying to coach professionals like what the **** are you talking about? </p>
<p class="body">How are you giving any health advice? </p>
<p class="body">When you look like that, your health is **** **** I'm not a doctor, but when you've got man ***** and a gut and you're walking around, you have these like toothpick arms</p>
<p class="body">I'm like, hey buddy, you're not healthy</p>
<p class="body">This episode is brought to you by athletic greens, even if you have the healthiest diet imaginable, it's hard to give our body everything it needs, which is why I take athletic greens</p>
<p class="body">Just one tasty scoop of AG 1 supports tumors 1</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Unhealthy, there's a lot</p>
<p class="body">Of profit to be made in in processing something into</p>
<p class="body">Beyond Burger, there's a lot of profit</p>
<p class="body">To be made</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But those aren't even selling anymore</p>
<p class="body">Have you noticed that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, they</p>
<p class="body">We're kind of lucky in a way like the the consumers kind of got in and poked around that</p>
<p class="body">And there was Forbes didn't interesting piece where they there was so much interest from the vegan community around Impossible burger and impossible foods</p>
<p class="body">And this warpspace was interesting</p>
<p class="body">It made the case that these people were usually very progressive and very anti corporation</p>
<p class="body">We're like the biggest fans or, or, you know, promoters of this corporatization of our food system, which is kind of where</p>
<p class="body">All this stuff is going what we're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're getting duped</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">They really are, but you know it's on the one side</p>
<p class="body">There's this story that meat will cause cancer and diabetes and all this stuff, and it's going to destroy the planet because of carbon emissions and it it's using all the water and the land</p>
<p class="body">And and it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's a slick story</p>
<p class="body">It's a</p>
<p class="body">It's an elevator pitch</p>
<p class="body">It's elegant</p>
<p class="body">It's like buttoned up air tight</p>
<p class="body">And then when we start trying to unpack that</p>
<p class="body">You have to dig into ecology and non equilibrium thermodynamics, and it's not an elevator pitch and it's a lot of work to to unpack what those claims are, and then you know even what is the motivation to do this</p>
<p class="body">Then we start getting into conspiracy theory</p>
<p class="body">Land is like, well, there are people that want to control the food system and they want to</p>
<p class="body">You know, turn food into intellectual property that they own, but</p>
<p class="body">It's that really seems to be what's going on with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">This, and I think they're they're not</p>
<p class="body">They've realized consumers aren't going to just buy it in the grocery store</p>
<p class="body">And by the way, it's twice as expensive like beyond burger is twice as expensive as organic grass fed beef</p>
<p class="body">Per pound, but they sell it in half pound packages right next to the pound packages and so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, they trick you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But so, why not just make it policy and indoctrinate these kids from kindergarten to age 12</p>
<p class="body">With these messages, like the Meatless Monday, messages are all wrong</p>
<p class="body">Like they're all wrong</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is the message? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Meat is bad for your health and the environment and and they use these beautiful simplistic infographics showing you know livestock takes up 3/4 of the land</p>
<p class="body">But but 
<p class="body">OK, but it's not talking about the types of land you know or that your burger used</p>
10 bathtubs full of water</p>
<p class="body">But then we're not talking about</p>
<p class="body">OK, that the most of the water footprint for a cow is actually in the grass</p>
<p class="body">It's called green water</p>
<p class="body">It's like water that's already in the environment</p>
<p class="body">In rain, whether the cow was there or not, it's going</p>
<p class="body">To happen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">We have that infographic like that one is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I have the the water one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really, if you want to talk about how much water a burger uses up, you better not be eating almonds</p>
<p class="body">Exactly, yeah, exact or not being you better shut your mouth if you're eating almonds, right? </p>
<p class="body">Those things are ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So here's the water one and I've broken it down</p>
<p class="body">Land use feed use, but this is just the water one, and So what most people don't get is that there's, you know, green water's natural rain. And then the blue water is like what when you look down on a map and see</p>
<p class="body">Rivers and lakes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So what we're looking at folks that are just listening is when you look at typical beef versus grass finished beef</p>
<p class="body">It looks like there's probably like how many dots are on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">A little different, so we're we're at the bottom. I have the percentages so it's 94% green water for typical beef and 97% green water for average, and this is average, like in Vermont</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">These things 
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It might be different than</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Nevada, but so they have it broken down to these droplets, and these droplets is 100 droplets on each side and two droplets</p>
<p class="body">From the grass finished beef or lakes streams and underground water, 3 droplets from the typical beef</p>
<p class="body">So and that's what everybody is concerned about</p>
<p class="body">What people are really concerned about the concerned about the draining of the lakes and streams and</p>
<p class="body">Underground water leaks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's not drinking water, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">And the rest of it, the entire graph is natural rain, which is rain that exists</p>
<p class="body">Moisture that exists</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, yeah, and I mean it's going to fall on this land, which is land that has been grasslands for eons and we can't use it for anything else</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And vegetable matter plant matter</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">When people say we</p>
<p class="body">We use all this land for cattle</p>
<p class="body">That's you know, bison or a a good example</p>
<p class="body">I'm good friends with the folks that own roam Free Bison Ranch in Montana</p>
<p class="body">They they do both cattle and bison because the cattle don't go up these super steep mountains, and so they you know they're these grassland mountains that the bison graze, and if they don't graze it then the whole ecosystem just collapses</p>
<p class="body">The the the ecosystem has been this plant animal interaction for millions of years and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This plant animal interaction is based on the animals manure fertilizes the plants, the animals eat, the plants, dung beetles</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Dung beetles, insects, birds</p>
<p class="body">You know all this stuff so it's not stealing land from anything</p>
<p class="body">This is what grasslands do</p>
<p class="body">It's not stealing water from anything</p>
<p class="body">This is the rain, sleet and snow that falls on the grasslands, and these animals should be there because it's part of a healthy ecosystem, like the Audubon Society in the last 10 years as beginning</p>
<p class="body">Really involved in regenerative act because one of the first things that they see when people start doing pasture based meat is that the bird species come back and come back in in remarkable profusion because it starts fixing</p>
<p class="body">If you fix all of the ecosystem issues, then these literal Canary in the coal mines end up getting addressed and we see more bird species</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Come back, this brings us to this whole idea of regenerative agriculture being scalable</p>
<p class="body">And and is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So I well first of all</p>
85% of the beef cattle in the US right now are grazing on land. We can't crop</p>
<p class="body">So these</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
85%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so 'cause cattle only spend about the last three or so months of their lives on feedlots and so really good grazing can happen even if they do</p>
<p class="body">End up being finished on grain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So most cattle are not all cattle, so they don't just eat grain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Off cap</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">From the moment they're babies, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">No no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They grass and then when they're getting ready to slaughter them, then for how many months they eat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Grain three to four are usually about 3</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then they basically get sick</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It depends on the system</p>
<p class="body">I mean it</p>
<p class="body">Like like this beef that I brought you today</p>
<p class="body">They're still out on pasture</p>
<p class="body">They're getting some grant</p>
<p class="body">I mean, there's there's there's like kind of middle ground</p>
<p class="body">It's not like all good or all bad</p>
<p class="body">You know, in an area where if if he were just to let his cattle graze</p>
<p class="body">They they cattle wouldn't have enough grass because there you guys aren't getting rain in Austin and so the cows would get sick so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How to do something to supplement what you're saying? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and we have</p>
<p class="body">I mean, we're going to have a brewery process we're going to if we're going to do ethanol, what are we going to do with all that stuff we can feed it to cattle to? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, but we're when we're talking about scalable when when something scalable and I guess we kind of glossed over the beyond meat thing, we probably should go back to that</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But is it scalable in terms of the entire population? </p>
<p class="body">Could you? </p>
<p class="body">Is there a like? </p>
<p class="body">What if everybody abandoned veganism if everybody is like, hey, I'm sick, I'm tired of this this is not working for me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Where I'm going to go to some sort of sustainable agriculture way of living is that without any factory farming, is that possible for the entire country? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">One thing I want to bring up is that Diana had went to Southeast Asia at the can</p>
<p class="body">We talk about the Merck deal and all that like antibiotics like I just want to throw that one out there because there's pieces of this system that cannot go on</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So we use a huge yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Cannot go on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So we use a huge amount of antibiotics</p>
<p class="body">In chicken and pork production, because of the proximity that they</p>
<p class="body">Like you, you can't do industrial chicken without the antibiotic inputs that we have because they're just on top of each other</p>
<p class="body">Merck and some of these pharmaceutical companies recognize this, and so historically like before the 1940s, chicken and pork were a background part of the food system, like pork was fed largely food scraps</p>
<p class="body">Chickens were just kind of a background part of of farms</p>
<p class="body">It wasn't a a main feature</p>
<p class="body">I think it was Herbert Hoover that said something like a chicken in every pot is like a</p>
<p class="body">You know, uh, campaign deal</p>
<p class="body">This was the beginning of the industrialized food system</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Chickens were expensive</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">We chickens were expensive</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it was usually beef and lamb and things like that that were the mainstay, but we know for certain that the current industrial food system is broken at the the grain production level because of the damage it does to the topsoil, and it's broken at the animal production level</p>
<p class="body">Because of the damage that it does to</p>
<p class="body">Our our antibiotic defense basically like if if we lose the ability to use antibiotics because of creating antibiotic resistant bacteria, we're all screwed like it, and so Merck is starting to educate folks that produce beef and or pork and chicken that we have to figure out sustainable ways of doing this</p>
<p class="body">And it looks a lot more like Joel Salatin or White Oak</p>
<p class="body">Farms where you're integrating all this stuff, so when people just immediately say, well, does regenerative AG scale? </p>
<p class="body">We definitely need to address that, but like the current system has an expiration date on it</p>
<p class="body">We have to find something else, and in the book and the film we don't lay out specifically, we didn't</p>
<p class="body">We're we're not trying to be future is saying this is the way that this is going to work, but a lot of what we suggest is that food production should be done at a regional level based off the resources and like the knowledge and the culture of the people that are there like</p>
<p class="body">What happens in Nebraska should be really different than what's happening in like Venezuela or something like that</p>
<p class="body">Like you have different resources, different infrastructure, different cultural values, but there should be an integration of plants and animals and the whole thing should probably look a lot more like an early 19th century farm with like good technology inputs than just</p>
<p class="body">Industrial Rd crops is kind of the ultimate thing that I think we take away from it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It does sound like he's dodging, so I did go through the numbers in the book and it does look like we have the land in the US right now to grass finish in a regenerative way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">All of our beef hurt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Before we go on to that, and I do want to talk about that like what it's causing the need for antibiotics specifically, is it the factory setting where everyone is jammed in together? </p>
<p class="body">That's what it is</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, when did that start happening? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
1940s, you know when we so we had the Haber Bosch process which made industrial ammonia</p>
<p class="body">For firearms and munitions, and then when we got done with that, we're like, oh, this stuff makes amazing fertilizer and it it really is amazing</p>
<p class="body">But it also damages the topsoil, but it it</p>
<p class="body">Produces huge amounts of food like ingrains inks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Makes great fertilizer but it destroys the topsoil at the same time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it it makes great fertilizer in that you can short term and by short term I mean like maybe a century, century and a half</p>
<p class="body">You can produce a **** load of food</p>
<p class="body">But when we think about our planet, we want our topsoil to last forever like we want to come back 5000 years from now and have this topsoil better</p>
<p class="body">Than what it is today, so there's there's tradeoffs, like in the short term</p>
<p class="body">It's good from a productivity standpoint, and we started getting</p>
<p class="body">Excess food production in a way that we could industrialize things like pork and chicken production by by the inputs of grains and whatnot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then in and then in the 70s is when it really ramped up with chicken and that's when people started getting like super affordable chicken</p>
<p class="body">Because there was also, I believe it was vitamin D</p>
<p class="body">They realized was a nutrient that these chickens really needed in order to thrive in a factory setting</p>
<p class="body">And then as soon as they figured that out plus the antibiotics, which not only keeps them healthier but actually disrupts their Biome enough to to make them gain weight</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, that's right</p>
<p class="body">That's right, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And so that those were sort of another couple of magical things</p>
<p class="body">And then in relation to the fertilizer, I just want to mention with the war happening or potential war</p>
<p class="body">We're also running out of fertilizer, so we have to start</p>
<p class="body">Using animals for nutrients because there's just not enough</p>
<p class="body">You have to mine potash and we you, there's just that's already a limited thing to in addition to nitrogen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So you mean fertilizer just for monocrop agriculture just for growing corn and soy and all that other stuff that we</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">The cropland, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Grow in massive massive quantities</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So a lot of the concerns that folks have like damage to waterways from effluent from like you know, CAFO beef production and chicken and all that</p>
<p class="body">It's terrible, but it's also something that if we did more decentralized production we broke this stuff up and we had</p>
<p class="body">Cattle integrated with pork, integrated with chickens and the effluent</p>
<p class="body">You know, their their byproducts, the the feces urine re integrate that into the soil</p>
<p class="body">Historically, that's what we've we did before the industrialization of the food system</p>
<p class="body">This is what people still do in most of the developing world is they have plant animal interactions</p>
<p class="body">Bringing this stuff together</p>
<p class="body">There's certain economies of scale that are really cool with the current system, but it's</p>
<p class="body">It's not like a Ponzi scheme, but I mean it's got an expiration date on it like we are breaking elements of our ecological system by kind of strip mining the the ability to produce lots and lots of food right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's one thing that I always try to say to people that are very plant based centric thinking</p>
<p class="body">I just</p>
<p class="body">Stress on them</p>
<p class="body">How unhealthy for the world monochrome monocrop agriculture is like this? </p>
<p class="body">Completely unnatural like you can grow food</p>
<p class="body">You can grow meat in a very natural way like the polyface farms model Joel Salatin's model, but if you want to feed the whole world with corn and grain</p>
<p class="body">You've got to have these massive fields and you're not going to grow anything else but this one thing in these massive fields</p>
<p class="body">And whenever you do that, you are damaging that ground</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's what lab that's what goes into lab meat and all</p>
<p class="body">Beyond burger and impossible Foods, they're not using organic products in</p>
<p class="body">I mean they're using</p>
100% Legit Chemical AG to make their products well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, now this is</p>
<p class="body">It's like one of the most processed things you could ever eat</p>
<p class="body">So all these people that want to eat healthy plant based like if you want to eat like a healthy vegetarian diet, you certainly can</p>
<p class="body">But if you want to eat a healthy vegetarian diet and also pretend that these process things that are filled with</p>
<p class="body">Seed oils and like what exactly is in a fake meat burger? </p>
<p class="body">And how bad are those things for you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So I mean just on a on a nutrient density level, they've never</p>
<p class="body">I've never seen a full breakdown like they'll say, total protein total fat and it'll line up, kind of</p>
<p class="body">But like the fats coming from soybean oil, not natural, the protein is limiting in the amino acids, but we still have yet to see a full</p>
<p class="body">Nutrient breakdown of all the junk</p>
<p class="body">We put in and of course it's better to eat real meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is what's the main ingredients of those burgers? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Pea protein is one of them and then</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I think soy ends up like on the oil front and then also just some of the protein also</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What if they mixed those burgers in with a branch chain amino acid profile? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Would you do that like have a bodybuilding beyond burger? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">You could you could be beaten</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Know make a lot of money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Make a lot of money, you make a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Of money, yeah, but you you're you causing inflammation</p>
<p class="body">Are you giving people issues with the seed oils like soybean oil? </p>
<p class="body">That's not necessarily good for you, right exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and and you're still like for every calorie that you consume of that you're not consuming something else</p>
<p class="body">So where are you getting the vitamins? </p>
<p class="body">The minerals the and you know these other</p>
<p class="body">Things in a in a developed world you you could go to your corner store and get vitamins and and do all that</p>
<p class="body">But what's kind of squirrely is that</p>
<p class="body">This whole story has been so tight into climate change, they're really pushing that the developing world adopt this stuff too</p>
<p class="body">And this is 1 interesting area that</p>
<p class="body">Different places in developed world have pushed back because they're like we can't be dependent on this like we have these traditional food systems</p>
<p class="body">And if you</p>
<p class="body">If you make us dependent on the exports of, like your industrial real crop food system, where one we're super dependent and two we we can't afford it, and then the Third Point which Diana really detailed this well in the book</p>
<p class="body">These folks don't have access to like a CVS to go get their B vitamins and their folate, and you know their zinc and their their iron and everything and</p>
<p class="body">The the same deficiencies that underlie a vegan diet looks shockingly similar to what people face when they're in a malnourished state in a developing country 'cause they eat a very starch centric</p>
<p class="body">You know monocrop type of type of diet</p>
<p class="body">That is typically the main deficiencies in there largely arise from a lack of animal foods</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So when when people talk about the difference between seed oils and there's other vegetable oils that are not bad for you, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like olive oil is not bad for you</p>
<p class="body">Avocado oil is not bad</p>
<p class="body">For you, why? </p>
<p class="body">Why are some corn based oils and seed based oils? </p>
<p class="body">Why are they bad for you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Just the the ultra processing and the the ratio of omegas in them, and they're polyunsaturated</p>
<p class="body">They're not really supposed to be heated, and so they're very unstable</p>
<p class="body">Create free radicals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So if you use them as salad dressing, are they? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, I mean, but they've already gone through the high heat process and are rancid, and they just kind of</p>
<p class="body">Add deodorizers so that you can't smell or taste the rancidity really yes, and then they also add coloring to make it look like a butter color, like you notice all the oils that that's not a natural color for canola oil to be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it white like a clear rather? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, there's an interesting video out there on the the Great Khan Ola and it shows the process of making canola canola oil it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Go to that Jamie</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You got that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's got it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm I'm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The great oil</p>
<p class="body">I'm kanola kanola, so canola oil is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Rapeseed oil that was invented in the 40s to be an industrial lubricant</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, the just the name alone is problematic, so these these seed oils, they're they're all rancid when they're stored in this way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They're they're usually go through a very high heat process in order to extract the the fat out of the seed</p>
<p class="body">So just that process alone renders them rancid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And if they didn't go through that process, there was there's no way to get the oil out of the seeds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So there's coldpressed, but then</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, like olive oil, some of its</p>
<p class="body">Gold price, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Or like grapeseed oil you you might see in a health food store that cold pressed grapeseed oil, but you, I suppose if you were to use it on like salad dressing and not cook it, it might be OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And is that OK? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's still not</p>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<p class="body">There's nothing redeemable about grapeseed oil like and</p>
<p class="body">I'd have to look up the Omega ratio, but you're much better with avocado oil or or just good olive oil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So why is avocado oil and veg and olive oil? </p>
<p class="body">Why those good for you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">They tend to be high in monounsaturated fat and then relatively low in the Omega 6 fats like they</p>
<p class="body">None of these things have much in the short chain Omega 3 fats</p>
<p class="body">Some people get kind of wrapped around the the axle though, like high oleic safflower oil is typically lower in Omega sixes than all of olive oil is</p>
<p class="body">So just on that Omega 6 Omega three side like it can get a little bit squirrely, but then you have the the additional piece of how was it processed? </p>
<p class="body">Like if it was cold extracted</p>
<p class="body">Then it's probably safer from like an oxidized fat perspective versus if it was heat extracted so it does get a little bit</p>
<p class="body">Complex, and that's where like a good quality olive oil or like butter or lard or tallow or something is just generally safer for most things</p>

<p class="body">The first device</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Then no worries, then we get to this these fake meat burgers and these fake meat burgers</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're using soy oil</p>
<p class="body">And then how are they making it look like meat? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I, I mean kitchen chemistry</p>
<p class="body">I mean some of the stuff that Shawn Baker has videos of just kids doing in there</p>
<p class="body">Somebody made a</p>
<p class="body">A pork roast, not a pork roast ham</p>
<p class="body">Somebody did a ham</p>
<p class="body">And when it, I couldn't believe the stuff they put in on the front end, but when they were done and they were cutting it like at it looked like ham in this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really see if</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean I, I was super impressed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You can find that way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">They actually commented on like it</p>
<p class="body">It kind of gives me a little gut ache to look at that, but I mean the finished product and this is somebody just doing it in their kitchen and I thought it looked just looking at it from a video</p>
<p class="body">They, if they had real ham and this fake ham, I wouldn't tell</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is Sean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Tell the difference</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Sean Baker would be on his Tik T.O.K you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Think probably yeah Instagram or Tik T.O.K, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's become a Tik T.O.K celebrity</p>
<p class="body">Yeah how many Tik T.O.K fans does he have? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">I don't know a lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's amazing they haven't kicked him off</p>
<p class="body">Tik T.O.K is ruthless with kicking people off</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's great with kids</p>
<p class="body">I have two</p>
<p class="body">Teenagers and my son follows</p>
<p class="body">Paul Saladino is now</p>
<p class="body">Also doing that diet like and meanwhile I've been</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Telling him forever? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's hilarious</p>
<p class="body">That's very funny</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I see his videos constantly, which is very funny to me</p>
<p class="body">That this is, you know, like this guy with a big knife</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Eating meat has become ultra popular, but they're like they're brutal with their censorship talk</p>
<p class="body">Just remove removes videos left and right</p>
<p class="body">Just call it hate speech and just yank you off, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but I I don't know exactly, but I mean they're going to extract the protein</p>
<p class="body">Some of the fiber they're going to extract the fats from these different things and then you start putting it together in a kitchen chemistry format to make it look</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like meat and their blood, like how they're making beet juice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Beet juice? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so here it is</p>
<p class="body">Oh wow, that's interesting so</p>
<p class="body">This person is look at his face</p>
<p class="body">Is he doing riding a stationary bike? </p>
<p class="body">Oh God, so they're making this like weird dough with some kind of flour</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably wheat gluten</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, weekly, weekly</p>
<p class="body">So this is going to give celiacs a ******* heart attack</p>
<p class="body">And then what is he doing? </p>
<p class="body">He's like rolling it around</p>
<p class="body">And then wraps it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But look at this</p>
<p class="body">One like that</p>
<p class="body">Looks like ham that looks like ham and that's just in this person's kitchen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Pretty wild, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">This is</p>
<p class="body">Vegan ham, yeah, but it's amazing</p>
<p class="body">Like the process that's involved in that, like all the kneading and twisting, like when he ties it into knots</p>
<p class="body">He's putting all this stuff in there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And in the film Sacred Cow, when I have Robin Joel Salatin talking about all the inputs that go into beyond burger and impossible burgers, I actually was able to use their own promotional footage</p>
<p class="body">Just with Robin Joel talking about how disgusting the process is and getting this</p>
<p class="body">What did you get? </p>
<p class="body">What did you call? </p>
<p class="body">It. Biological goo</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Just over their own promotional footage of how what a miracle it is of of these vats, that they've you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, we need to see that is that available online? </p>
<p class="body">Can someone see that the the process of making it beyond burger? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It was just</p>
<p class="body">It was an impossible foods, it's it's</p>
<p class="body">I can look if he can't, it was just the impossible foods like making of impossible foods</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and The funny thing is is they're only claims, so they can't win on nutrition</p>
<p class="body">They try to win on ethics right? </p>
<p class="body">So they try to say no animal died for this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, here it is</p>
<p class="body">The making of an impossible burger</p>
<p class="body">Wow, it looks legit</p>
<p class="body">Look at that</p>
<p class="body">It's so</p>
<p class="body">Looks like a burger</p>
<p class="body">There it is</p>
<p class="body">How do they taste? </p>
<p class="body">I haven't had</p>
<p class="body">One I haven't had one</p>
<p class="body">Don't you think you? </p>
<p class="body">Should have one just to comment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I could take that bullet I guess</p>

<p class="body">I feel like I should</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">No, there's there's another one with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Take they actually put him in it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh wait a minute</p>
<p class="body">No, I did have one</p>
<p class="body">I had one my friend CK brought it to one of the shows that Chappelle and I were doing at Stubb's</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Do you know if it's one of these? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Uh haem the magic ingredient the impossible burger heme he himself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It could be that one because you can see the vats in the background</p>
<p class="body">And you just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Anyway, I had one I had a burger that was in it and it just like tasted like a bland burger</p>
<p class="body">It was from some local place that makes some plant based burgers and then some like real burgers</p>
<p class="body">So this is them getting excited about these smash burgers that are made</p>
<p class="body">Look at these guys</p>
<p class="body">This is just like a real burger</p>
<p class="body">Has anybody ever eat them and go? </p>
<p class="body">What the **** is? </p>
<p class="body">This this is not a burger</p>
<p class="body">Why are you feeding me this man? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, it's some great kitchen chemistry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, look at the fake blog, the Beet juice and then they have to get the flavor profile right? </p>
<p class="body">But basically when you're eating it as a burger? </p>
<p class="body">Then you're eating all the other stuff, the bun</p>
<p class="body">And there's the lettuce and the tomato and the pickle and those you know</p>
<p class="body">Maybe you had a little sauce on there or some ketchup</p>
<p class="body">It's probably easier to get that as a reasonable facsimile</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">With all the other stuff, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that looks like beet juice</p>
<p class="body">I drink beet juice</p>
<p class="body">Should I drink beaches? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It releases nitric oxide like beets and beet juice are pretty legit</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really good, like before training right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But in limited amounts, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because there isn't too much robeats toxic, yes? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, yeah, the salicylates in it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah it could give you make your kidneys fail</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Too much raw beets, so every now and then have a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Beet juice I think more like a Oz or something</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's funny that these people think that they're eating something healthy while they're eating this big *** bread bun</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of funny, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's kind of funny like the the promotion of this as a health food and then you see them eating this fat bread bun</p>
<p class="body">They're like, hey? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So, so they can't really win on health</p>
<p class="body">They've all given up their health claims</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Have they? </p>
<p class="body">What was the initial health claims? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Pretty much the you know that it's healthier and everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Looks good, I gotta say that looks good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They'll say it's less saturated fat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Don't look good Jimmy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Is that is the cheese healthy and watch it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Too, I like cheese</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Very nice</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I like cheese</p>
<p class="body">It was probably vegan cheese too</p>
<p class="body">Unfortunately right? </p>
<p class="body">Which is like who knows what that is</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">It's a lot of whatever it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it's a crazy burger that's for a glutton who's also a vegan? </p>
<p class="body">Who's 80 stacks of? </p>
<p class="body">Patties on that sucker, but Umm, so you're you're saying like their initial claims that have been invalidated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so now when I go to their</p>
<p class="body">Websites, I don't see a lot of health claims and and I do know someone who's working on really taking</p>
<p class="body">Those products and comparing them to meet like and breaking it out for vitamins and minerals, 'cause it's just not going to win</p>
<p class="body">But now so their main claims are now carbon, less carbon</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And completely ignoring all the other</p>
<p class="body">Ecosystem function pieces that monocropping</p>
<p class="body">You know, but at least</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The damaging aspects of it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's less</p>
<p class="body">Right, so like in all these you know, United Nations Food Systems Summit</p>
<p class="body">We all have to</p>
<p class="body">Reduce our carbon and everyone is so</p>
<p class="body">Laser myopically focused on just carbon</p>
<p class="body">And that I think really comes from these fake meat companies, because that's the only thing that they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Have you know is that a valid claim that production of this fake meat is like pound for pound or reduction of carbon emissions versus animal based? </p>
<p class="body">How so? </p>
<p class="body">Like even the grossest version of animal based agriculture and factory farming</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Because most of the greenhouse gases are coming from cattle as part of their digestive system, its methane gets emitted</p>
<p class="body">And after 10 years the methane gets broken into H2O, Water and CO2, carbon dioxide</p>
<p class="body">And it goes back down into the plants. The plants release the O2 in photosynthesis and then the carbon becomes the plant, the roots, and then it can actually store carbon in the ground and then the cow eats the carbon and so it's a cycle. And I actually have a graphic showing that methane cycle versus fossil fuels. So fossil fuels are mining</p>
<p class="body">Ancient carbon from the Earth's core and pumping it straight into the atmosphere</p>
<p class="body">With no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It it couldn't be part of a cycle, but it's going to be through plants and animals</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">So we're we're seeing a there's a</p>
<p class="body">Uh, a beautiful 
<p class="body">Sort of a chart infographic chart that shows how the carbon from the atmosphere gets converted</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Infograph yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In the methane, it's converted and so a lot of people think it's cow farts</p>
<p class="body">It's actually cow burps that are the big producer of methane, right? </p>
<p class="body">And then it shows the cows carbon cycle meat and milk and how the poop</p>
<p class="body">And this is like that explain this without saying everything on the chart B</p>
<p class="body">And even if</p>
<p class="body">I said it wouldn't work</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I have them</p>
<p class="body">I have all these charts at sustainable dish back slash Rogan and people can just take them and share</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh OK, great sustainable dishes your website</p>
<p class="body">OK, So what the difference is when the cows are emitting this map, they were thinking of it as just carbon</p>
<p class="body">Carbon equals bad, but the carbon that they're emitting and the way that this there is a cycle that they're eating this grass they're belching</p>
<p class="body">It goes into the air. It becomes H2O and carbon and then it. The carbon goes back into the ground</p>
<p class="body">It gets into the grass</p>
<p class="body">They eat it again and it goes on and on and on, and it's a normal part of what it means to be a ruminant animal on a planet that has grass, and they eat that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Grass yeah. And so in the US in North America</p>
<p class="body">We don't have more methane emitting animals than we did before we got rid of the bison and the elk and all the other natural ruminants that were already here, and so we don't have a net bigger amount of methane</p>
<p class="body">We just have cows instead of bison and deer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And the crazy thing is, even if we did, but it's still part of a cycle to get to the point where the cow is emitting methane yet to pull carbon dioxide out of the air into the plant gets sequestered in the plant until the animal eats it, but it this cyclical part really</p>
<p class="body">And yet Steven Koonin recently like he talks</p>
<p class="body">I think he talked a little bit about the the differences between the cyclical you know pieces of this story versus just mining ancient carbon and and releasing it, but</p>
<p class="body">It it the accounting really needs to be different because the danger that we get into</p>
<p class="body">We discovered recently that shellfish produced huge amounts of methane at termites rice paddies</p>
<p class="body">Like there's all, these biogenic methane sources that then people start freaking out and there was actually some some scientists that were asking, should we eradicate shellfish so that we reduce their carbon footprint and it's like they're suggesting that we</p>
<p class="body">Reduce the amount of life on the planet so that we can protect life on the planet and</p>
<p class="body">It it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Or in Sweden with the moose</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah Sweden there there there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">The Green Party in Sweden wanted to kill all the moose in Sweden because they emit methane</p>
<p class="body">They didn't go through it</p>
<p class="body">Didn't pass, but it was proposed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh my that's so ***** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">God and this is this carbon tunnel vision where you get so focused on carbon release and you lose the bigger picture of all this other stuff that's going on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is so ***** Kill all the moose because they admit carbon, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause they admit, methane? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">That's what's driving these poor kids in New York to eat vegan school lunches, and I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So who started all this nonsense? </p>
<p class="body">Where's this? Is it bill? </p>
<p class="body">Gates I think</p>
<p class="body">It bill I'm a I'm</p>
<p class="body">A fan of your operating system, but once I'm</p>
<p class="body">I'm not all bad on you buddy</p>
<p class="body">I think you need better friends but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean we we we go into it a little bit, how meat became a scapegoat and</p>
<p class="body">Meat is a very powerful</p>
<p class="body">It's the most powerful food we eat</p>
<p class="body">It's it's it's it's masculine, it's strength</p>
<p class="body">Bloody it like it</p>
<p class="body">It represents a lot of things that you know we used to have sacrificial</p>
<p class="body">Meat is also seen as barbaric and impure and unnecessary and too masculine and so</p>
<p class="body">There's this like deep weird cultural narrative that's really hard to tease out exactly where it all came from initially</p>
<p class="body">I mean, we idealize vegetarian cultures as more purer than ours, and there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a really great example of that just showing</p>
<p class="body">I have two graphs, 1 showing the ideal diets in the world and then one showing the global malnutrition</p>
<p class="body">And it's interesting how the ideal diets are causing the malnutrition</p>
<p class="body">But we're idealizing them because there's no harm, and it's pure, and it's</p>
<p class="body">All of that, I think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So how are the ideal diets causing malnutrition? </p>
<p class="body">Is it from a lack of? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Animal Source foods 100%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But is it? </p>
<p class="body">Can they be like this has always been the big debate, right? </p>
<p class="body">Can you have a vegan diet and and be completely healthy? </p>
<p class="body">Can you do it? </p>
<p class="body">Is there a right way to do it like we're talking about adding sustainable or adding amino acids? </p>
<p class="body">You know, adding vitamins, is there a way to do it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I think it's all if someone is young and healthy already</p>
<p class="body">Probably was raised, breastfed well and and raised on enough, you know</p>
<p class="body">Good nutrition</p>
<p class="body">There does appear to be some people that</p>
<p class="body">Do OK on a vegan diet for a period of time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is there a rough estimate of like what percentage? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, no, I, most vegans, you know, give it up. 85% give it up within three months</p>
<p class="body">And it's usually a health event</p>
<p class="body">It's not ideal, I mean just from a pure</p>
<p class="body">Humans are omnivores and we need the nutrients and animal source</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Foods I'm reading about this guy was a vegan</p>
<p class="body">It was a vegan for years and he finally decided to he's having all these health problems and he ate a piece of salmon and he said it felt like he was having an orgasm</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, like he couldn't believe how good his body felt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I read that one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like it's like</p>
<p class="body">It's it's SAC like I hate being the I told you so guy, you know like I hate like I I want people to be able if if they if you don't want any animals to die for your food</p>
<p class="body">And they're going to die anyway, unfortunately</p>
<p class="body">But if you want that, does anybody? </p>
<p class="body">Want coffee or? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Anything good good? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Because of that, you know you you don't like, I mean it just</p>
<p class="body">It's it's an uncomfortable discussion 'cause so many people are so ideologically connected to this idea that a vegan diet is like better, more calm, free, like healthier</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And we're seeing what we're seeing with younger people</p>
<p class="body">Is that health isn't driving it, it's ideology that's driving it, right? </p>
<p class="body">And so they will suffer personally for their ideology, and so they're really clinging onto the carbon story and the ethics story</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A lot of them become these vegan influencers and then they get busted eating fish</p>
<p class="body">Like that then they get attacked by the community</p>
<p class="body">I've seen that happen multiple times where people were like really suffering and they started eating meat and then people went crazy on them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Or there was that piece where if they're out drinking, they have a tendency to snack on, like some burgers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yes, oh, that's a giant percentage of vegetarians will eat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Meat when they're drunk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, you know when we when we set in to do the book and this was a long time ago, we thought that we were going to tackle the ethical part of this thing first</p>
<p class="body">So we cover the health, environmental and ethical considerations of a meat inclusive food system is kind of the big deal</p>
<p class="body">But one of the things that became interesting, Diana really kind of spearheaded the health side of the research is that it becomes really hard to grow a human on a vegan diet</p>
<p class="body">I mean like you look at moms and their nutrient needs and then passing that to the next generation breast milk raising kids like</p>
<p class="body">When you start trying to attack, you know push this thing forward</p>
<p class="body">It's really hard</p>
<p class="body">People can do it, but it's So what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're talking about when a woman is pregnant</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, and there's been documented cases of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Was it Finland? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Pregnant, what's that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Was it Finland that they they did the interview with the Welt like wealthy Finnish families that were vegan and like they they had really? </p>
<p class="body">Pretty terrible nutrient deficiencies within these folks, and these</p>
<p class="body">They're wealthy</p>
<p class="body">They're educated, they're supplementing</p>
<p class="body">And they weren't able to consistently pull this off, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we see babies, so B12 deficiency</p>
<p class="body">Causes permanent brain damage</p>
<p class="body">Or it can</p>
<p class="body">And and B12 supplements. If vegans take the vegan version of the B12 supplement</p>
<p class="body">It is actually</p>
<p class="body">An analogue. It's not real B12 and your your cells think it's B12? </p>
<p class="body">They'll absorb it, but then it it actually blocks real, but it can make your B12</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It blocks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's a B12 analogue. It's not actually B12, it just pretends to be B12</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I thought you can get B12 from algi</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not true B12 really, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So when you're getting B12 from like blue green algae and spirulina and all that kind</p>
<p class="body">Of stuff like what are you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's above my pay grade</p>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">I I think it's, uh, in isomer</p>
<p class="body">I think it looks</p>
<p class="body">It it may be like the folate needs to be a right hand shape and this stuff is a left hand shape and so it it can plug in and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And so is it partially effective, is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So there was a documented case of a a vegan breastfeeding mother who was supplementing with B12, and her baby died</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And she was supplementing that with the vegan form knows that this could be a rare issue with her</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it could be could</p>
<p class="body">As well, yeah one person, but when we look at general populations</p>
<p class="body">Kids who don't have access to meat are much more likely to be stunted, to have delayed cognitive development, physical development, behavioral problems, and we only have one study that looked at kids with</p>
<p class="body">Meat versus less meat</p>
<p class="body">There's only one randomized control trial</p>
<p class="body">Everything else is like, oh, this population hate me and this one didn't</p>
<p class="body">And these guys got more cancer</p>
<p class="body">It must be the meat, but you know that's you can't like make policy on those observational studies</p>
<p class="body">So this randomized control trials in Kenya, the kids at school that got a meat snack</p>
<p class="body">Did better than the milk group and the over calories group</p>
<p class="body">And that's the only evidence that we have, and so there's no evidence at all that pulling me away from children is going to result in healthier kids</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now when you get a standard B12 supplement like non vegan, what is that from? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm honestly not sure</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if they extract it or if it's purely synthetic I, I think it probably</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If you get a synthetic version of B12, wouldn't that be sufficient for a vegan to? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I I would think so yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I know that</p>
<p class="body">That there's non vegan forms of B12 and I</p>
<p class="body">Don't know what it's from</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But like actually not analog, but actually the actual B12. OK so</p>
<p class="body">When a person is doing that like what what is going on in their body, their body thinks it's B12, so it acts like it's got enough B12 and then it's just not getting it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's Chris Kresser writes about it</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to</p>
<p class="body">Pull up his</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Study right now</p>
<p class="body">So like for</p>
<p class="body">There's certain toxins that you can do competitive inhibition so that the toxin doesn't get into cells</p>
<p class="body">So it's something that looks like the toxin it it binds to the receptor site</p>
<p class="body">It could keep it out, but it can work both ways, so you can have different nutrients in our body</p>
<p class="body">Like amino acids are like they call it L lysine and L DOPA and whatnot because they're they're left hand shaped you it</p>
<p class="body">If you were to put them together in 3D space, they could have an orientation that's either left handed or right handed</p>
<p class="body">The right handed amino acids by and large aren't biologically active, and so there's a number of things like that that it within the nutrients that</p>
<p class="body">Trying to think of another one like DL phenylalanine like people will use that for chronic pain</p>
<p class="body">It's both the D and the L form</p>
<p class="body">Normally L phenylalanine is the form that we use, but the D form of phenylalanine seems to have some interaction in the brain where it it? </p>
<p class="body">It actually causes some pain reduction, but normally the the D or the R form of of</p>
<p class="body">Those types of nutrients don't really work in our our Physiology</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">One of the things that you hear about a lot lately is the idea of bugs being a viable food source, and that might be a way to get vegetarians or vegans to eat</p>
<p class="body">Like a sort of a living protein source because</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of vegans that don't seem to give a **** about bugs</p>
<p class="body">It's really interesting</p>
<p class="body">Like I, I lived next to an ashram when I lived in Colorado and I I was visiting this lady who lived at the ashram</p>
<p class="body">We were talking about something and she was spraying bug spray</p>
<p class="body">She was killing Bugs and I was like, hey? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">What's the story that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're supposed to be a Buddhist like you're not supposed to be killing bugs, and she's like, well, there's you know certain concessions that we have to make, and we have bugs that</p>
<p class="body">Get in our trash</p>
<p class="body">And I was like, Oh my God, like how do you Europe a murderer like this is like mass scale, slaughter, of of life forms, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Look at like</p>
<p class="body">We have to make this distinction like what is important</p>
<p class="body">Is it life or is it life with fur? </p>
<p class="body">Is it life that weighs more than a pound? </p>
<p class="body">Is it like like people don't seem to get that upset? </p>
<p class="body">If you kill a bug right, you could kill a bug on you and not even dispose of the body</p>
<p class="body">And no one freaks out, like if you swat a mosquito</p>
<p class="body">You just basically kind of like move your hand a little bit and **** you</p>
<p class="body">It's like small enough that we seem to be OK with that thing, just</p>
<p class="body">Where's the body like? </p>
<p class="body">Where did you put that? </p>
<p class="body">You just murdered a life form? </p>
<p class="body">No one gives a **** but if you stomped on a mouse in front of people, they'd be like what the **** is wrong with you, rob? </p>
<p class="body">Why do you just stomp on that mouse? </p>
<p class="body">That's gross? </p>
<p class="body">Clean that like it gets to a certain level where we decide it's either cute enough or large enough you know, and when it gets to things like a Buffalo</p>
<p class="body">That's why it's large enough so that like that's too big to kill, but that is that equivalent to an Ant because that Lady is out there spraying bugs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It matters, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">She's killing at least a life form</p>
<p class="body">Is that one life form? </p>
<p class="body">That's an Ant? </p>
<p class="body">This tiny little thing is that as valuable to you as a big bison, and if not, why? </p>
<p class="body">Tell me why? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then, especially if you look at how it's produced, right? </p>
<p class="body">Regenerative AG versus typical monocropping</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So if you're going to have one cow</p>
<p class="body">That's almost Â£500 of meat</p>
<p class="body">And if that cow was raised in a way that increased total life underground and above ground and brought all these birds back and everything</p>
<p class="body">That was a life that actually led to more life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well if you buy corn, you're definitely responsible for some death</p>
<p class="body">There's just no if ands or buts about it though</p>
<p class="body">If you have a mono mono crop field of corn, the only way they're going to keep those animals from eating the corn and to keep you know when when they plow over the corn and they extract it, things are dying</p>
<p class="body">There's just no if ands or butts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">About it and then they'll say it</p>
<p class="body">But I didn't intend for it to die</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know if that's good enough, you know? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, if you're like shooting a gun into a crowd and you don't intend for anybody to die</p>
<p class="body">But people die</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think you're still responsible for that death</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it doesn't hold up very, very well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, you don't</p>
<p class="body">You might not be looking where you're pointing the trigger, but I think that this idea of a 0 sum game this this idea of never losing any life</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of crazy, and one thing that people that are proponents of plant based diets really hate is when you bring up plant intelligence</p>
<p class="body">They really hate that they really hate the idea that plants might not just</p>
<p class="body">Have strategies to avoid predation but might have</p>
<p class="body">Real time maneuvers that they do in terms of like changing their chemicals where they changes their flavor profile emitting these</p>
<p class="body">These defense chemicals 'cause they don't want to get eaten, and there's some sort of an intelligence that plant plants not just have, but they have with this symbiotic relationship</p>
<p class="body">Two fungus under the ground and these these mushroom, the mycelium, and the root structures of these plants are sharing resources and they communicate and they it's a really complex system that reeks of intelligence and we don't totally understand it, but we have this thought in our head that if it doesn't</p>
<p class="body">Move then it's OK to kill, even though it's a life form, but we've made this distinction that a plant life it it does not have the same feelings</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't cause pain</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't cause emotional harm</p>
<p class="body">It's not like us, it's as removed from us as possible while still being alive form to the point where we could just</p>
<p class="body">Eat it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, in order to make a field for a corn or soy also you have to annihilate whatever was there before like whatever forest like you're killing habitat and animals</p>
<p class="body">In order to make room for this monocrop to happen, and then the pesticides and insecticides and all that stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Too yeah, and just having that kind of a structure where you have this one plant growing in this massive quantity is totally alien to anything that you ever find on Earth in in terms of like I mean, maybe you'll find grass like large grasslands</p>
<p class="body">But then again, the grasslands is sort of like this weird little honeypot where the Buffalo come over and eat the grass and they **** 
<p class="body">And then the bugs and the whole thing, and the manure</p>
<p class="body">And it feeds itself</p>
<p class="body">It makes sense there's none of that going on with a monocrop</p>
<p class="body">Soybean well and it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's really not a monocrop too, like there can be dozens or hundreds of different plants in that that grass ecosystem, and they change throughout the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">True good point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Season and yeah, good point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and the amount of cropland that we have that can actually support that</p>
<p class="body">That has healthy enough soil rainfall or access to irrigation is flat so that you can drive a tractor over</p>
<p class="body">It's actually quite small now bugs</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Are bugs good for you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">For eating them, yes I have</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I've heard that they are</p>
<p class="body">I don't think my my opinion on like crickets is that it's going to be a great animal feed for like chickens</p>
<p class="body">Don't think</p>
<p class="body">Or maybe a bardar</p>
<p class="body">For for dudes, you know, yeah, like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're talking to the guy used to host fear factor</p>
<p class="body">Crickets are small potatoes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Compared to paying you to writing everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean I've eaten</p>
<p class="body">I ate so much garbage when I was on that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Show, but I don't see them as</p>
<p class="body">Like a regular</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But they do have their good source of B vitamins, right? </p>
<p class="body">I believe their B12 rich like you could eat like crickets in there. I believe they're a good source</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably because our animal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and you know it it it's a little bit even like the cultured meat though, is that you still need an input to feed those critters</p>
<p class="body">And I'm not, I think that they could and probably should play some sort of a significant role going forward</p>
<p class="body">But what is it that we're going to allocate to those critters? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, grow them here to grow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Feed them with and where you gonna grow them and what kind of how much land do you? </p>
<p class="body">Need to grow crickets also cricket</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Farms are disgusting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Are pretty nasty</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, why? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, any picture of a cricket farm</p>
<p class="body">They're like these cardboard tenement cities</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, I've never seen it, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, there's a lot of cricket poop, and if you if you don't right so my daughters got really geeked out because they want to figure out some</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is this a cricket farm? </p>
<p class="body">These are cricket farms cricket farm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So if you don't manage them, the crickets become cannibals and they</p>
<p class="body">Eat each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh Jesus, of course they do monsters</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So look at their crawling all over the walls</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can you can you show me a video of a cricket farm? </p>
<p class="body">I wanna see what they look like</p>
<p class="body">So when I was in Mexico, we checked into this hotel and they had a bowl of cooked crickets and it's like a a normal snack and my girls were like</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, I'm not eating</p>

<p class="body">How do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That, oh like I'll eat it</p>
<p class="body">I got one of my daughters to eat it</p>
<p class="body">She ate a cricket</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">We used to get a a cricket protein bar and my girls liked</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, see this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It they're kind of salty, so why? </p>
<p class="body">What do you have to do to keep them from eating each other? </p>
<p class="body">Just make sure they have a lot of food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It you to make</p>
<p class="body">Apparently it hits some population threshold and then they'll just start</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh God, like nature has a built in safe mechanism to make sure that and so that's them all ground up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Killing each other</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is that like a cricket cheesecake? </p>
<p class="body">What it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Looks like a carrot cake</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Character yeah carrot cake rather oh look</p>
<p class="body">At her she's bold, she sticks</p>
<p class="body">Her tongue out with cricket</p>
<p class="body">On it so</p>
<p class="body">So these are like different kinds of cricket proteins that they've turned these things into and cricket snacks</p>
<p class="body">So look at this poor guy</p>
<p class="body">Why is he got a mask on? </p>
<p class="body">It's because of the pandemic or just chicken smell</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably chicken</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's hard to tell right these days like why are they wearing masks? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it because of the pandemic or is it because this is what they do when they? </p>
<p class="body">Work around</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So these guys are working so they tighten the the shells</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Cricket ship</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Like you can get a an allergy to it, kind of like a shellfish allergy, so they're probably wearing it for that, it's it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, isn't it very closely related to shellfish? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean, if you have a shellfish allergy, you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, I can speak to this if, as when we were on fear factor, we found out that if you have a shellfish allergy, you are also allergic to roaches</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Can't can't eat yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we found that out by feeding people roaches</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, that's a nice way to find it out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And then in EpiPen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And they're they're throat seized up and I had to leave the show</p>
<p class="body">Yeah sorry dude</p>
<p class="body">Crickets are anthropoides like shrimp, crabs and lobsters</p>
<p class="body">This means they contain some of the same protein</p>
<p class="body">So individuals who are allergic to shellfish may develop an allergy crickets</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, would have been nice if the people that were run in fear factor ******* ask those folks</p>
<p class="body">But hey, it's a long time ago so</p>
<p class="body">Are they? </p>
<p class="body">What's the protein and the nutrient profile of a cricket? </p>
<p class="body">Is it similar to? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">An animal I</p>
<p class="body">I think they're really good, you know, like pound per pound</p>
<p class="body">Their conversion of feed into basically nutrient upcycling, I think, is really good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Here, look at this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Crickets are good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber</p>
<p class="body">In addition to protein, crickets are high in many other nutrients, including fat, calcium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, copper, folate, biotin, pantothenic</p>
<p class="body">How do</p>
<p class="body">That pathetik acid and iron one study found that the iron content of crickets was 180% higher than</p>
<p class="body">That of beef</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But you'd have to eat a four ounce</p>
<p class="body">Block of cricket</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You wouldn't be doing that if you were</p>
<p class="body">Hungry, but if they're good they taste good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">If you have the right dipping sauce</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Lobsters taste good</p>
<p class="body">If it's a shellfish thing, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like shellfish, tastes good, right? </p>
<p class="body">Everybody loves lobster, right? </p>
<p class="body">If if they take, I mean, isn't there a? </p>
<p class="body">Way yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And you know, I think that this is at least some of the questions that we need to ask. Like right now, 50% of the food that we produce globally isn't eaten</p>
<p class="body">It basically gets landfilled and so we could, you know when people start asking about scalability</p>
<p class="body">At a minimum, we should be better about what we do with the food that we have</p>
<p class="body">Like there I forget the name of the outfit, but</p>
<p class="body">Some folks in New Mexico, they have a pork operation and they've made relationships with the local</p>
<p class="body">Grocery stores and restaurants and basically their their food that doesn't get eaten, expired food they send it to the pigs, they autoclave it, they basically sterilize it, and then they feed it to these animals and this would have otherwise just gone into a landfill</p>
<p class="body">We could do this like everywhere and this is part of the problem that we have is because of zoning and because of cultural things like we could produce a lot more food in kind of a regional</p>
<p class="body">Fashion and then be much more efficient with it. We could cut it like 50% of our food is wasted right now. So what if we took 10%? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that just nationwide or is that really? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's kind of a global global number, yeah, So what if 10% of that got allocated into cricket and mealworm and different things and we use those to produce a possibly vegan acceptable protein source or it gets used to feed the chickens so that they you know there's just a lot of inefficiency there</p>
<p class="body">But there's also a lot of like cultural change that needs to happen to make some of those things more</p>
<p class="body">More acceptable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is sort of unrelated, but there was a guy who ate bad Chinese food</p>
<p class="body">It was like leftover Chinese food</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">And to get amputated stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, he his body went septic</p>
<p class="body">He had to get his legs amputated, his feet amputated</p>
<p class="body">The photos are absolutely horrific, it was just some, some leftover food that apparently it was sitting out</p>
<p class="body">Maybe something and bacteria got in it and he ate it and within hours</p>
<p class="body">Afterwards, his body was going septic, like in it's he has these lesions all over his body</p>
<p class="body">Wait till you see this is so crazy</p>
<p class="body">I've never seen anything like this from eating food</p>
<p class="body">I thought if you ate bad food you just get diarrhea and you throw up and need a food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Apparently he got</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Poisoning really</p>

<p class="body">I mean, I've I've had food poisoning</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure you guys have as well, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's gross, it's it makes you feel terrible</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Was it like Botulism? </p>
<p class="body">Did he get Botulism from it or no? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I I can't I don't know you find it</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's just noodles, they're just showing noodles, that's unfortunate</p>
<p class="body">Anyway, second, I found it and it it was a</p>
<p class="body">It was horrific</p>
<p class="body">This guy had like his feet were like a gross multi colored thing and it's all of his skin and it was just from it going septic from bad food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">How bad did that smell when he ate it like I mean, how bad does it have? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It might not have smelled bad</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I'm having you had food poisoning</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">To be bad</p>
<p class="body">Oh yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It didn't smell bad</p>
0:00:05 <h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Patient had a rapidly evolving diffuse reticular purplish rash on the face, not shown</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Chest and abdomen, arms and legs, so his whole body was covered in these horrible purple lesions</p>
<p class="body">And barely made it</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's really, really rough when you see it</p>
<p class="body">It's horrible</p>
<p class="body">And so let's go to the top of it</p>
<p class="body">So like figured out what happened</p>
<p class="body">OK, so the patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission</p>
<p class="body">This is crazy when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after gate, rice, chicken and LogMeIn leftovers from a restaurant meal</p>
<p class="body">Multiple episodes of emesis so the word emesis occurred with vomitus that was either Billy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4>

<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What are they trying to do to be here? </p>
<p class="body">Billious or red brown? </p>
<p class="body">The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse</p>
<p class="body">My ologists my al, is that right? </p>
<p class="body">Malgus chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision</p>
<p class="body">Five hours before this admission</p>
<p class="body">Purplish discoloration of the skin developed and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation</p>
<p class="body">Upon arrival, the emergency department of the hospital 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias. The scale of eight to 10, including indicating most severe pain on examination</p>
<p class="body">Beard pale, anxious, and moderately distressed, he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time and situation</p>
<p class="body">OK, blood specimens were obtained. Complete culture content approximately 40 minutes after the patient's arrival</p>
<p class="body">Da da da during 30 minutes Tak Tak E Fina, worsened and labored, breathing hypoxemia</p>
<p class="body">Sionne sisters, a lot of ******* medical terminology here</p>
<p class="body">Supplemental oxygen was administered so he was like fading fast</p>
<p class="body">Resulting in oxygen saturation of 83%. Oxygen was administered through a high flow nasal cannula at the rate of 40 liters per minute. Wow, so this is oh, this is a medical thing. Is a medical journal. It's talking about this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It it never really says they they did cultures on it, but it didn't say what he</p>
<p class="body">Came back with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He smoked 2 packs of cigarettes weekly</p>
<p class="body">That's not a lot smoked marijuana daily, hala, and drank 2 alcoholic beverages of pot approximately 2 times per week</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Crazy OK, no more Chinese food</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's not that</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">I think I read of another friend</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">I think I read of another friend ate it too, but he didn't get as sick</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">He just had like a little stomach ache and this kid went the other way with it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh wow, I don't know</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">I think I read that it's not saying that</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">In here I</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Don't think but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh wow, I read it initially that dude's got bragging rights</p>
<p class="body">I'm here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">That's all he's got left</p>
<p class="body">Should they cut everything else off? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know the other guy, the other guy, the guy? </p>
<p class="body">That didn't get</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">That's right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Cut by the guy that also ate it but didn't</p>
<p class="body">Really get sick</p>
<p class="body">Right, you know when he's</p>
<p class="body">Wheeling his friend around</p>
<p class="body">Remember, I eat the same food</p>
<p class="body">Bro stuff are horrible</p>
<p class="body">Horrible joke, so do you think that that there is a future where people can have this sort of? </p>
<p class="body">This, you know, this philosophy of having a plant based diet is like to do the least amount of harm</p>
<p class="body">Now, if you had some sort of a organic back garden diet and you lived off of your garden, that's probably the most karma free, right? </p>
<p class="body">If you just want to eat plant based foods and then you have crickets for your protein</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It depends on where you live because</p>
<p class="body">In most of the country you can't grow year round, so</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It gets tricky and I think if we're talking about least harm and one of the things like Rob was starting to say with you know everyone likes to lead with these ethics arguments</p>
<p class="body">I want to do least harm, and so we were going to lead the book with ethics</p>
<p class="body">But my</p>
<p class="body">Thinking was that you have to fully understand the nutritional implications of like pulling meat away from people who really need it, and then you have to understand the environmental argument of like</p>
<p class="body">What monocrop agriculture is and all that kind of stuff to then understand the ethical to to have like an intelligent ethical debate</p>
<p class="body">You can't just say it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so when we're talking about nutrients and we were talking about the impossible burger and beyond burger and stuff like that</p>
<p class="body">So they don't really claim that it's better for you nutritionally anymore they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Not so much</p>
<p class="body">I mean there you know there's new crazy studies come coming out saying that you should limit your red meat to 0 if you want to live</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They imply it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But those aren't</p>
<p class="body">This is going to</p>
<p class="body">Get reversed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Those are going to be exhausting though, 'cause you're going to have to talk to somebody that have read those studies</p>
<p class="body">They're going to stick in your face</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I have a friend who's overweight who's a vegan who's like to claim that I'm going</p>
<p class="body">To have a heart attack, I'm like bro</p>
<p class="body">Look at you</p>
<p class="body">This is so crazy like you</p>
<p class="body">You can't be healthy eating whatever you're eating is not good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And I think for a healthy, you know 25 year old athlete or whatever they want to be vegan. That's fine as a mom and a dietician. I have a big problem with</p>
<p class="body">Disadvantaged kids being</p>
<p class="body">Meat being pulled away from them as policy for virtue signaling</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">For sure, but as an athlete, when an athlete is a young, healthy athlete and they're eating a vegan diet, do you think they're leaving something on the table in terms of like the nutrition that they could be getting and the performance that</p>
<p class="body">They could be getting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Totally, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It seems like it seems like it right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I don't I'm not aware</p>
<p class="body">Of any top of the food chain LeBron James type people that are vegans</p>
<p class="body">You know, like when you look at it elite athlete</p>
<p class="body">You know Canelo Alvarez, like someone, is at the very top of their game</p>
<p class="body">You know, I don't really see any of them that I'm aware of that are vegans</p>
<p class="body">Doesn't mean it's not possible, but I mean, I don't know of any</p>
<p class="body">Who's the best in their field? </p>
<p class="body">That's a vegan</p>
<p class="body">Do you know of any? </p>
<p class="body">Are there any soccer players that are? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I'll hand, I don't</p>
<p class="body">I mean, there's always this</p>
<p class="body">This piece too of could they have been better? </p>
<p class="body">You know, maybe they are riding vegan</p>
<p class="body">Or maybe they could have been better with kind of a mixed diet</p>
<p class="body">You know, it's always a tough one</p>
<p class="body">It does seem like you know, like the the Game Changers movie</p>
<p class="body">Like all the athletes, they kind of detailed in that thing</p>
<p class="body">They everybody went retrograde after they they went vegan like the the strongman guy got injured a bunch and kind of retired like everybody that they had in there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Strongman guys a tough case because that guy is chock full of steroids</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Kind of yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There's just no if ands or butts about it</p>
<p class="body">I mean, that's a that's a steroid up business</p>
<p class="body">You know when you're when, unless they're testing people on a regular basis and there's there, I'm sure there's some that do get tested when you're dealing with those guys that are just enormous human beings that are lifting the most amount of way possible</p>
<p class="body">A lot of those guys</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Around the juice and that can</p>
<p class="body">Paper over a lot of other stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's hard to say like what's? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Really going on then, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well and also with these athletes</p>
<p class="body">They're genetically gifted, period, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like they can probably get away with eating a lot of fast food and be</p>
<p class="body">Pretty a lot healthier than me, you know</p>
<p class="body">So I think you know when you're already starting with</p>
<p class="body">Like the ideal specimen of human</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then if they give up plans for or meet for six months, it may not have the same impact as somebody who</p>
<p class="body">Has already damaged guts or an autoimmune disease or as an older person or as a developing kid who needs you know to grow so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There's been some football players that went vegan right that were like elite football players, but didn't one of them just kept getting injured after he went vegan</p>
<p class="body">Yeah well, why would you get it? </p>
<p class="body">Is it lack of protein? </p>
<p class="body">Do you? </p>
<p class="body">Think like what would I think? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Just globally you are consuming less nutrients and definitely the protein piece is a big deal and then if you aren't recovering the same way like do you track heart rate variability, do you ever? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do when I wear that whoops route</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yep Yep Yep, so like if</p>
<p class="body">What's a cool insight with HRV? </p>
<p class="body">Is that if you're sleeping well on your your total stress load, your allostatic load is low comparatively</p>
<p class="body">Then you've got more resources to put into recovery, but if you're eating a diet, whether it's junk food or or what have you, that is</p>
<p class="body">Causing some degree of stress that is not providing the fundamental building blocks, then more energy has to be allocated to get you back to square one again</p>
<p class="body">So this is where like optimizing sleep and nutrition and gut health and all these things</p>
<p class="body">Really it is something that if you make money from your physicality, like it behooves one to do that because you want to put</p>
<p class="body">Every bit of recovery you know juice into that process because it gets you back in</p>
<p class="body">You can train harder, train more often, so that's where I could see</p>
<p class="body">Like the soft tissue injuries and stuff like that starting to</p>
<p class="body">Be a problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's it's kind of guesswork</p>
<p class="body">When a football player gets injured because it's kind of an injury sport, it's a sport</p>

<p class="body">There's so much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's you would be really cherry picking if you said</p>
<p class="body">This is why you got injured, right? </p>
<p class="body">So back to this burger thing</p>
<p class="body">So the burger has soybean oil, pea protein, beet juice</p>
<p class="body">And what else is in there? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">That's I think those are the main</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then they what kind of malarkey are they doing to glue it all together? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, we saw again like pretty impressive stuff, just with what the person did in the kitchen making the the ham, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that would that look nasty honestly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But looked like damn at the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It did look and it looked ham ham like, but the burger looked pretty damn good with the cheese, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">End, you know? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah him yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Top of it</p>
<p class="body">It was looking all</p>
<p class="body">Greasy, yeah, that looked pretty good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's soy protein concentrate coconut oil sunflower</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">PokÃ©mon all is good for you, right is not</p>
<p class="body">Good for you, yeah</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there's something good for you. Ingredient #2 is good for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You sunflower oil potato protein</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that good? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't eat</p>
<p class="body">You need to eat 10 potatoes to get the protein that you can get in 4 ounces of beef</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And and just really quick on that, what do you need to do so if they're marketing this as like a sustainability feature? </p>
<p class="body">How much energy goes into? </p>
<p class="body">Raising a potato it, you know</p>
<p class="body">Bunch of potatoes</p>
<p class="body">Then you process them</p>
<p class="body">Extract the protein out so it can be put into that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">This is where you know, like the what they call a life cycle analysis and they did do that between like white oak pastures and and the impossible burger and white oak pastures ended up having a lower carbon footprint</p>
<p class="body">And again, that's not the whole story, but there there's</p>
<p class="body">Other pieces to it, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm sorry white oak pastures in comparison to two</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Beyond burger and impossible burger</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So this is compared to factories or</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Their their their burger, the the process of creating</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">From the ground</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, a life cycle is like a cradle to grave study where it's the whole</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So they're following all the plants that can be converted into seed oils and all the all the jazz</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">That I mean</p>
<p class="body">There's probably limitations on how far back in the supply</p>
<p class="body">I know that they didn't go into some of the mined minerals that they need for</p>
<p class="body">You know all the vitamins and minerals you know, like they didn't go that far</p>
<p class="body">But pretty far</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And what was the result? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">The white oak pastures ended up being net carbon negative, so it's pulling more out of the environment than what it's putting in throughout their whole process</p>
<p class="body">And this includes the composting and the the inclusion of like their chicken and pork like</p>
<p class="body">It's the whole operation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now is this pound for pound like? </p>
<p class="body">How do they do this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it I believe so</p>
<p class="body">It was</p>
<p class="body">It was literally like a pound per pound comparison, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A pound for pound from a regenerative farm, pound for pound for beef and chicken and whatever they grow</p>
<p class="body">Whatever animal based protein versus this plant based stuff that there's more carbon being emitted from the plant based stuff and the production of and it's worse for the environment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and in funny it it was kind of weird, but I think it was literally the same number but the opposite direction</p>
<p class="body">It was like you had to eat 1 white oak pastures burger to nullify the carbon footprint of 1 impossible burger like it was like 4.6 or something like that. Yeah yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I think it's yeah 3.5 or something like that, so it's a it's a grass fed beef farm in Georgia</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So in terms of harm to the environment, that's so that, at least from a regenerative farm, a regenerative farm like white oak pastures</p>
<p class="body">And how do white oak pastures run their thing? </p>
<p class="body">They run it like polyface farms and like that kind of deal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Very simple yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, now we were talking earlier about sustainability, like the ability or scalability, rather the ability to do that for the entire country</p>
<p class="body">Is that really possible? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so I I consulted some of the top experts in this area when I wrote the book and we went through the numbers and if we</p>
<p class="body">If we look at the underutilized grassland that we already have, so there's a lot of like BLM land or Forest Service land that's just not being grazed</p>
<p class="body">There's farmers being paid through the CRP program to actually leave their fields fallow</p>
<p class="body">So if we if we</p>
<p class="body">Look at regenerative agriculture as actually being way more efficient than</p>
<p class="body">Typical grazing and I put that at 30% better, but most farmers will tell you I have four times</p>
<p class="body">You know more animals on my property because my soil is so fertile and the grass is so healthy</p>
<p class="body">So I did go through the numbers for the US and it does look like we have</p>
<p class="body">The land to finish 'cause remember all cattle start on grass so it's really just those last three months that we're looking to finish where we're looking to take them</p>
<p class="body">It takes longer, but it's the three months that would be in a feed lot</p>
<p class="body">To then finish them on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Grass, but to finish them on grass</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It would take longer than three months, but but we're not looking at the entire life of the cow is not spent in a feed lot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, but when you're saying feed lot, are you saying when you are they feeding them hey are they feeding the grass or they feeding them? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Grain, so add a feed lot</p>
<p class="body">They're getting like a ration of corn of mashed up</p>
<p class="body">Right, you know corn stalks from the ethanol industry, so they're getting like like food scraps that we can't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And this is the fatten them up</p>
<p class="body">But what about pure grass fed, which is supposed to be supposed to be the most healthy, correct? </p>
<p class="body">Is that debatable? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It yeah it is actually</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">This is one of the things that gets us in a lot of trouble</p>
<p class="body">Like we, we started with a bunch of assumptions and one of the assumptions was that</p>
<p class="body">Pastured meat is nutritionally superior to conventional meat and we</p>
<p class="body">I mean we</p>
<p class="body">We turned over every study that you could find in this thing and what what you find is that pastured meat has a little bit more Omega threes than conventional meat</p>
<p class="body">But if you're looking at just the Omega threes, you need to eat like 8 pounds of meat to get as much Omega threes as what you get out of, like 3 ounces of salmon</p>
<p class="body">So it's not the place to look for that and</p>
<p class="body">Pastured dairy is far more nutritious than conventional dairy wild caught</p>
<p class="body">Seafood is far more nutritious</p>
<p class="body">Eggs are far, far more nutritious</p>
<p class="body">But it's this weird thing like it would have been so nice if just pastured meat was like</p>
<p class="body">Nutritionally superior, we could have like</p>
<p class="body">Had this, you know, soup to nuts story on this thing</p>
<p class="body">We even hired an independent researcher person with a PhD in nutritional biochemistry and we just said hey do a compare and contrast of conventional meat and grass fed meat</p>
<p class="body">We want to know their nutritional profile</p>
<p class="body">We didn't give this person any of our information and they arrived at exactly the same thing</p>
<p class="body">But we have people really</p>
<p class="body">Angry at us</p>
<p class="body">But they did</p>
<p class="body">At the end of the day, the crazy thing is even when you're putting things like corn stalks and weird things like that into cows, they make they're so good at upcycling nutrients that meat is just ruminant meat is super, super nutritious, and I think that the ethical argument for grass finishing is strong</p>
<p class="body">I think the environmental</p>
<p class="body">Argument is strong</p>
<p class="body">There may be a case for like bioaccumulation like things like like phosphate and stuff like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I looked at those two</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But that's separate from it and and I don't think it's as compelling a a thing is what most people would think, but just nutritionally like vitamins, minerals, you know, proteins, essential fats, essential amino acids</p>
<p class="body">There's just not that big of a difference</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Why is it look so different 'cause it's a darker red meat and I would assume? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's leaner</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's definitely leaner</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So finishing on corn marbelize, is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's the only difference in terms of the color</p>
<p class="body">It's just a lean thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah so yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Because I was assuming it was like a nutrient density thing</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's kind of nutrient dense because there's more of the actual meat versus fat for sure</p>
<p class="body">There is a benefit to the fat from me as well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a nutrient too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So there is probably some benefit to a fatty piece of meat that is grain finished</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean it has more calories, so it just depends on what your goals are, but it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Versus even grass, right? </p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Not bad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not bad, so the Omega threes is the only big issue, but you really should get that from salmon</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Anyway, yeah, I mean, it's like saying an organic carrot has three times the protein</p>
<p class="body">No one is eating carrots for protein</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, got it? </p>
<p class="body">Got it so</p>
<p class="body">So if we were doing that and you're trying to feed the entire country, how much more of an impact does the methane from the cows burping, and how much more of an impact is it in terms of the amount of animals that you have to move around in terms of transportation and the fossil fuels that are emitted through that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So ironically, I'm going to Brazil next month to speak at a cattle conference, and they are actually having to go more towards feedlots because they're getting so much pressure to reduce their carbon emissions</p>
<p class="body">And so when you finish a cow on a feed lot, it's faster, and so the cow is not alive as long</p>
<p class="body">And so they're emitting less methane, so it's actually</p>
<p class="body">This one company, it's actually they're being pressured to go the feed lot route</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And and this is that carbon tunnelvision where they're missing all the other</p>
<p class="body">Externalities that could be beneficial around the pasture process, like you can reverse desertification</p>
<p class="body">The ground holds more water</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't create as much of a heat footprint</p>
<p class="body">You get carbon sequestration</p>
<p class="body">You have all the other ecosystem benefits</p>
<p class="body">But this is where like this kind of neurotic focus on just greenhouse gas emissions</p>
<p class="body">Absent this bigger picture, you start making dumb decisions and we're making decisions at a global food policy level that are are potentially going to be really injurious, like what they're doing in that that process then, and I think</p>
<p class="body">They're looking just at the</p>
<p class="body">The emissions are coming from the animals in that case, but then what about all of the infrastructure that's necessary to get the grains to feed to the animals? </p>
<p class="body">And what's going on with that? </p>
<p class="body">And I think when we do these full lifecycle analysis like what we do with the white oak farms</p>
<p class="body">Usually the pastured process wins</p>
<p class="body">But you have to be willing to accept that</p>
<p class="body">That is part all that greenhouse gas emissions is part of a cycle</p>
<p class="body">That stuff that's in the atmosphere today is going to be part of a plant at some point, and you know then part of an animal and and on and on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now when you're talking about the amount of cows that you would need to feed the entire country, like what kind of a quantity of meat are we talking about, per capita or per person? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So right now, Americans eat about 2 ounces of beef per person per day and about twice that much chicken</p>
<p class="body">So we're really not eating like too much meat</p>
<p class="body">Everyone thinks that Americans are sitting down to a tomahawk steak every night, and it's just not true</p>
<p class="body">You know we're going to get our protein from different sources, so I'm not saying we all need to be carnivores</p>
<p class="body">And you know then you have this other dilemma of the carrying capacity of earth for humans, which gets really dicey when you even start talking about that</p>
<p class="body">So we we don't talk about that, but you know, do you want healthy humans or do you want human feed to just have the largest number of humans possible? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, right so 2 ounces of beef a day does not sound</p>
<p class="body">Like a lot</p>
<p class="body">So, but if you want people specifically to live on this diet like I'm living on like if that</p>
<p class="body">If this is something that people adopt now you're talking about many times more</p>
<p class="body">How much is is that sustainable? </p>
<p class="body">That seems like no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know, like I I don't know where that carrying capacity pops in and I don't know it</p>
<p class="body">It's interesting, you know how much of that could be supplemented with seafood</p>
<p class="body">How much of that gets out? </p>
<p class="body">Like if we start integrating like the pork and the chicken and making that whole bio dynamic and not as as impactful</p>
<p class="body">How much of that could be offloaded into like? </p>
<p class="body">Insect proteins like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But if everybody ate like Sean</p>
<p class="body">Baker we'd be ****** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Probably would be some problems</p>
<p class="body">Probably some problems</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">We also we're exporting all the organ meats to other countries</p>
<p class="body">We're not doing a very good job of of eating those</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a flipside to this</p>
<p class="body">Is that as as a culture we're super unhealthy</p>
<p class="body">So like there was a Congressional Budget Office</p>
<p class="body">Study back in like 2005 that was suggesting that by like 20 thirty 2035 the US is bankrupt from diabesity related costs like we will we have more costs dealing with diabetes than what we? </p>
<p class="body">We have GDP and I don't know what kovid is done to that whole projection and and whatnot, but it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just diabetes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Just diabetes alone and this isn't even looking at like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and all these other metabolically driven diseases</p>
<p class="body">And if there's one thing that although I guess it's still controversial, but there's, there's one thing that there's at least a little bit of synergy out in the world</p>
<p class="body">People like Layne, Norton and and whatnot kind of sign off on this</p>
<p class="body">If people under eat protein, they tend to overeat calories beyond that</p>
<p class="body">Who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Looks like you're working</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I saw you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And so whether you eat higher carb or lower carb, if people eat adequate protein, they tend to not overeat</p>
<p class="body">The other stuff if you under eat protein then you tend to overeat</p>
<p class="body">All the other things and this is probably the</p>
<p class="body">The big driver of of this illness so</p>
<p class="body">What do we do about addressing the health and health care issue in all this, you know, like in some ways we can't</p>
<p class="body">Not we can't afford not to address this in some effective way because we have to figure out like a</p>
<p class="body">A global public health food policy that's going to allow people to spontaneously reduce calorie intake, or</p>
<p class="body">We we end up with this kind of global control of the food system and you go to buy meat and it's you know it's like a social credit score thing</p>
<p class="body">It's like, sorry comrade, you've already got your protein allowance for the month</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and then I looked into also the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's time to debug, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">The carbon footprint of diabetes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, with all the medical tubing and</p>

<p class="body">So you've got</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's easy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Amputations, you've got dialysis, all the plastics involved in dialysis</p>
<p class="body">I mean so, but that shouldn't that be factored into? </p>
<p class="body">Junk food, you know? </p>
<p class="body">If we're if we're complaining about like methane from</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I guess it has to be if how many people are gonna bankrupt the country from diabetes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean if that's real</p>
<p class="body">I I had no idea that I thought diabetes was fairly rare</p>
<p class="body">OK, here the staggering cost of diabetes</p>
2.3 times greater healthcare costs for Americans with diabetes $327 billion. The annual annual cost of diagnosed diabetes in America more than 34 million Americans have diabetes. Holy **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's just diagnosed, right? </p>
'cause there's so many more people on their way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">More than 88 million have prediabetes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, there we go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Food, so you're almost at half the population</p>
<p class="body">That's either pre or diabetic</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is, but</p>
<p class="body">It's a third essentially, but that's still a lot of ******* people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">One in three is either diabetic or pre diabetic</p>
<p class="body">That's nuts. What if we found out that the obesity rate in America was like 40% right? Wasn't it something like that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">If you add overweight and obese at 70%</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
70%</p>
<p class="body">Wow, see that is something that you know</p>
<p class="body">Obviously this is anecdotal, but you know, Jordan Jordan Peterson was one of the first guys that I knew that got on that carnivore diet and he lost 40 something pounds</p>
<p class="body">He looks amazing and it's just like he's completely slim and lean and he just eats nothing with steak like</p>
<p class="body">There's something about eating meat where you get satisfied easier</p>
<p class="body">When I'm eating meat by itself</p>
<p class="body">I'll you know, I'll eat a steak and I'm fully satisfied, but if you give me a steak and pasta, I will eat</p>
<p class="body">I will eat that steak, and then I'll eat the **** out of that pasta and I'm somehow another still hungry</p>
<p class="body">I see I keep digging in there wherever it was steak</p>
<p class="body">It was another steak</p>
<p class="body">There I'd stop and I'd, you know I'd put it in the fridge</p>
<p class="body">But I can't stop</p>
<p class="body">Eating when it's pasta or bread? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah that buffet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Effect is is interesting where if we get more food</p>
<p class="body">Yes, and eat more more things</p>
<p class="body">When I was on the show last time, we looked at that Adam Rickman, man versus food and he did this kitchen sink sundae challenge</p>
<p class="body">I think we watched this this thing, but he had to eat at 8 pound ice cream sundae and he's motoring through this thing he gets maybe 15 minutes into it and then he just starts visibly turning green</p>
<p class="body">And like starts gagging</p>
<p class="body">And he's not going to make it</p>
<p class="body">And he asked the the waitress in this place to get him a a giant plate of salty crunchy French fries and he would eat a couple of French fries and then a little bit of ice cream and a little bit of French fries</p>
<p class="body">But because he was able to go back and forth and change the palette experience, his brain didn't tell him to stop</p>
<p class="body">So the only way he would have thrown up, he would have failed</p>
<p class="body">Eating that ice cream sundae without eating like 2000 calories of</p>
<p class="body">French fries, which is just crazy, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, but there he</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Weird weird tricks</p>
<p class="body">You have to play in your brain</p>

<p class="body">Oh yeah, here we go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is yeah, look at him</p>
<p class="body">He looks so much different now since he doesn't do that show anymore</p>
<p class="body">He's all like normal size</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like that guy must have been killing himself</p>
<p class="body">I mean just killing himself doing that show</p>
8 pounds of ice cream is absolutely nuts</p>
<p class="body">That is so</p>
<p class="body">Bad for you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's orange Sherbert at the bottom</p>
<p class="body">I mean good God</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's good right now he's getting after it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so your body has this weird thing</p>
<p class="body">If you just eat protein like when I eat like steak and eggs in the morning, I'm very</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Satisfied, yeah, so we're in this horrible place where people are saying, but it's unsustainable</p>
<p class="body">And so</p>
<p class="body">So that's why we</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I think we've proved it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, so you have to you have</p>
<p class="body">To start with, what is the ideal diet and how can we produce that in a sustainable way? </p>
<p class="body">But all the other groups are saying look at our broken AG system</p>
<p class="body">What's the most sustainable food and how can we convert that into human feed? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, they're not even just doing that</p>
<p class="body">It seems like they're playing funny games with the numbers</p>
<p class="body">Like where they are</p>
<p class="body">They're not being honest about the environmental impact</p>
<p class="body">They're not being honest about the nutritional footprint</p>
<p class="body">They're not being honest</p>
<p class="body">About any of these</p>
<p class="body">Things they just want this ideology promoted, which is that meat is bad for the environment</p>
<p class="body">Meat is bad for the</p>
<p class="body">I mean I see that everywhere and then people say it on Twitter</p>
<p class="body">They say it's like it's just this like cold statement, they just say</p>
<p class="body">Meat is bad for the environment, like what? </p>
<p class="body">Kind of meat like what are you saying in what way? </p>
<p class="body">Like yeah, is are you saying like those pig farms where they leave lakes of sewage? </p>
<p class="body">Yep, I'm with you</p>
<p class="body">That's bad for the environment when they have these horrific factory farm conditions where they're all packed in next to each other and they ship through the bottom of their cage</p>
'cause it's a great</p>
<p class="body">And it goes into this this big swampy sort of lake of sewage</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's terrible, but if you're talking about like what Joel Salatin does 
<p class="body">No, my thing is though</p>
<p class="body">You're not going to get everybody to listen right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">We haven't had anybody listen like like and I used to work at NPR</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">When people say that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I have friends there they want to</p>
<p class="body">Touch this story</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I know people at New York Times they wouldn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's a thing, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, Netflix was super interested in her in the film</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They flew me out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And got like right to the 11th hour, 59th minute and then somebody was like, oh **** like we can't. We can't sign off on this so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Meanwhile they have the most wacky documentaries that are so full of **** on so many different things right on UFOs and Bigfoot</p>
<p class="body">And ******* you know, the origins of currency</p>
<p class="body">Netflix got some wacky **** so does iTunes</p>
<p class="body">I went to the other day I was at home</p>
<p class="body">I had a rare day off so I just went through the documentary section of iTunes for a goof or Apple TV</p>
<p class="body">And it's like what kind of ******* ********* are you people selling? </p>
<p class="body">And you won't sell this</p>
<p class="body">It's my what I was going to say though</p>
<p class="body">Is like you're not going to</p>
<p class="body">There's certain people that are just</p>
<p class="body">Headline readers, and that is a headline reader statement that meat is bad for the environment</p>
<p class="body">This is a thing, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It aligns so perfectly with so many other narratives today too, so it's just all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Also, that are just headlines, you know</p>
<p class="body">And there's</p>
<p class="body">This really weird tendency to ignore facts that are contrary to what you've already espoused and believed in, and this is one of them</p>
<p class="body">And once you've already said publicly multiple times, meat is bad for the environment and animal based diet is bad</p>
<p class="body">Plant based diets are the only diet that reverses heart disease</p>
<p class="body">They like to say that one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so like</p>
<p class="body">I'm in a suburb outside of Boston and everyone</p>
<p class="body">The more environmentally conscious, right, they're educated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a mess</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Poor people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Of course they don't eat meat</p>
<p class="body">None of them eat like or they're cutting down, or they're flexitarian</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not other people near you, and they're all tying</p>
<p class="body">They're all exhausted</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, they all look like **** That's what's weird</p>
<p class="body">I mean obviously not in some of them look great this you're going to run into that vegan soul jacked so bro, I'm a vegan</p>
<p class="body">I'm ******* hell to **** like</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">TouchÃ© you're one of the rare ones</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're a ******* Unicorn pal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But it is tough because it's such a airtight</p>
<p class="body">Beautiful story, you know</p>
<p class="body">If if you don't eat meat you'll live forever</p>
<p class="body">You'll be skinny</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's heart disease, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">You'll be ethically superior</p>
<p class="body">You're saving the planet, I mean sign me up, it sounds great</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The ethnicity, superior parts people love that one people huff that one</p>
'cause the social media social media is just</p>
<p class="body">It's such a great place to espouse your virtue, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that if you can, you put that little plant thing next to your your bio and then put your pronouns</p>
<p class="body">Underneath that, you're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Off and running</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Nice, you got a solid pro, you know</p>
<p class="body">Solid bio there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And then what we're? </p>
<p class="body">Suggesting we don't even have like a solid endpoint other than</p>
<p class="body">Mainly we we make the recommendation that</p>
<p class="body">As to the greatest degree possible, decentralized the food production system and depending on where we</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How so when you say that what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you mean by that? </p>
<p class="body">So people in Nebraska should probably be doing things different than people even in Texas? </p>
<p class="body">And and I'm not in that crew where people get all bent out of shape that lake and avocado is going from Mexico to Canada during the winter</p>
<p class="body">Like I don't care about that</p>
<p class="body">I do think that</p>
<p class="body">More of our food should probably be eaten</p>
<p class="body">Locally but</p>
<p class="body">If we produce more food locally where we have much more efficiencies generally, and then a lot of these environmental problems like the the lakes of like steaming pig **** and stuff like that should just be worked back into the farm we we shouldn't be poisoning waterways</p>

<p class="body">This would stop, why? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They shouldn't be growing pigs that way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">The pig should be integrated into the whole system the way that we did about 100 years ago</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But don't you need a vast swath of land to accomplish something like that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Not necessarily because you, you don't need to always do mega scale and it</p>
<p class="body">This is some of the stuff that we're going to have to</p>
<p class="body">Come to terms with also</p>
<p class="body">So like in the UK, there was an experiment where they they put in hedgerows, around the the regular</p>
<p class="body">You know conventional farms that they had but the hedgerows allowed</p>
<p class="body">For these predatory birds and and insects to have somewhere to hang out and then they would get in and and eat the the the bugs that would you know cause problems with the you know like the weed or the</p>
<p class="body">Corn or whatever</p>
<p class="body">So there was a decrease in the total amount of harvest that they had because some of the farm was allocated these hedgerows</p>
<p class="body">But then the amount of insecticides and herbicides and whatnot that they had to use were dramatically decreased</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Ah, I see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So we have to start putting what our values are like</p>
<p class="body">Markets are really good at optimizing things, but we're not</p>
<p class="body">We're not telling it currently what we've asked it to optimize is make as much cheap food as possible, and we've crushed that</p>
<p class="body">Like we, we've we've crushed it. I think it was 2006, 2007 became the first year somewhere around there that more humans started dying from</p>
<p class="body">And over eating than under eating and and infectious disease like chronic disease outstripped infectious disease and and lack of food as the main cause of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Death that's interesting 2007</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">So somewhere, somewhere around that point, nobody you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's the tipping point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But a big</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's kind</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Of a tipping point, but it's a really important point in history</p>
<p class="body">But we crushed that imperative</p>
<p class="body">We produce huge amounts of calories, but now it's to the point that people are so sick that we're crippling our health care system and people are unhappy and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause what I was getting at in terms of sustainability is that if you have a pig farm that is a factory farm pig farm, you're raising thousands of pigs on a relatively small footprint you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">What you need is more smaller farms with some some pigs, and you need people to you need not 5 corporations to own the supply chain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Spread out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But this is a bigger problem</p>
<p class="body">What I'm saying is like if you run a pig farm and you only have X amount of acres and you have thousands of pigs on that pig farm, that's the only way you're going to be able to raise the same amount of pigs on that farm</p>
<p class="body">You're gonna have to bring in food to them</p>
<p class="body">You have to keep them contained</p>
<p class="body">You fatten them up and then you kill them and you have this giant lake of their their their feces</p>
<p class="body">This is what is the only thing that you kind of can do to have that kind of yield on a small piece of land. Relatively small, like you have 100 acres and you have 10,000 pigs in these</p>
******* containment facilities. You're not going to recreate that in 100 acres with like the Joel Salatin method, correct? Like if you if you're going to do regenerative farming, you're going to need some land</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">You need some land, but you're also going to need to have a different supply chain</p>
<p class="body">You're going to need to sell directly to consumers and not meat as a commodity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But what about meat? </p>
<p class="body">As a commodity, to place like Burger King or Jack in the box, or what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Have you do that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> video </h4> 
<p class="body">They still</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean that that's still even happens too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Joel Joel sells to Chipotle</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Chipotle is a pretty good source, like Chipotle has</p>
<p class="body">I mean, when you get like a a good beef burrito, they're a beef bowl</p>
<p class="body">Pretty damn</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Good, I mean in a scenario like that then I don't know how Joel handles his</p>
<p class="body">But if you're selling to McDonald's, then McDonald's gets its meat from more regional source versus like this consolidated</p>
<p class="body">I would source the way that happens now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you anticipate a time where they'll be able to? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, I know there are doing factory cloned meat now</p>
<p class="body">Do you think that that will be scalable? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">No, like the short answer is no because it's so expensive to do it like Pete</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But for now, like it used to be a really expensive to get a cell phone, but now they're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Fairly cheap, it it's true and and I'm a huge fan of Moore's law</p>
<p class="body">It's a really good point, but the the thing that kind of gets missed in this is that it's so expensive to run a lab like I actually did tissue culture and you have to take all the products of industrial farming</p>
<p class="body">Pull that out, process it, and then you know I've got protein and carbs and fat and these these you know jars that I put into this VAT and then inoculate it with meat cells and have to keep it the right temperature or the right humidity</p>
<p class="body">I have to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Keep pathogens off it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Keep pathogens off of it, so I've got to use antibiotics that there was actually been</p>
<p class="body">A couple of good business pieces like Forbes and stuff like that</p>
<p class="body">Looking at these things and and some smart systems engineers looking at this and they're like there's just no way you're going to scale this, you know, and people just</p>
<p class="body">They don't realize like the grasslands in the United States or even in like Eurasia and</p>
<p class="body">Whatnot, they're just</p>
<p class="body">Enormous and we have these huge tracts of land</p>
<p class="body">Sunlight, grass, animals it</p>
<p class="body">It's a really efficient system versus again trying to pull that all under</p>
<p class="body">You know a roof like this and try to grow meat at scale</p>
<p class="body">If you're on like a spaceship or something, you have a closed loop deal like I could see something like that working, but as long as we have the sun and grasslands and and whatnot, there's still</p>
<p class="body">A really efficient piece of that now correct me if I'm wrong on this, but as marijuana has become more legalized, people have gone outside frequently to to produce it where they can because it's just cheaper like the infrastructure of that versus like a greenhouse scenario is tends to be pretty pretty economically viable, so I think you run into those similar situations with</p>
<p class="body">The lab grown meat and and the kind of butting up against the scale piece</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You'd have to talk to a real marijuana farmer, but I I think there's some questions about</p>
<p class="body">You know quality and how you grow it in the soil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, like the difference between the hydroponic versus growing it outside</p>
<p class="body">And yeah</p>
<p class="body">What other pieces of the puzzle are missing in terms of? </p>
<p class="body">Like if we're if we're looking at beef and nutrients, we're looking at the carbon footprint</p>
<p class="body">We're looking at all these different things in terms of like</p>
<p class="body">Like a viable and sustainable food source, what other pieces are we missing? </p>
<p class="body">In this discussion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I mean one thing I was going to bring up is just with white oak pastures and the impact he's had on jobs and this town like he's in the poorest</p>
<p class="body">County in the country</p>
<p class="body">And when, as we've lost in South Western Georgia</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Where is that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And to see what he has done on this property is incredible</p>
<p class="body">And he sells direct to consumers and so he can get a good margin</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">When he sells direct to consumers</p>
<p class="body">Does he have like a like a farmers market type deal where they come to him? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">These ships 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He ships so he does it online</p>
<p class="body">So you could just like buy a side of beef, a half a cow you could visit by the pounds, cuts, steaks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Cuts, yeah, but they also have restaurants that they supply too, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">What the beauty of of that and also</p>
<p class="body">You know some of the stuff that Wendell Berry talks about</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if you've ever heard of him, but he's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a great documentary they did on him called look and see and he's an agrarian</p>
<p class="body">Thought leader and he just talks</p>
<p class="body">About how you know everyone from small town, you haven't really made it in the US until you've left your small town and nobody is like coming back and actually working in their small town and loving the land that they're from and making sure that that gigantic, nasty polluting pig farm doesn't happen</p>
<p class="body">So that's part of it</p>
<p class="body">But as we've lost all these small farms, small town America has just completely dried up</p>
<p class="body">And now it's just big box everything</p>
<p class="body">And so if we're able to sort of dismantle these like</p>
<p class="body">For meat companies that control 80% of our meat</p>
<p class="body">And somehow get it back to a more balanced system where there's more regional control over the food systems you're going to have more healthy</p>
<p class="body">Small communities 
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">This gets out in the weeds a little bit, but when people talk about AI supplanting jobs, it's creative jobs that are going to be the last things that go like even doctoring and lawyering, it is so</p>
<p class="body">Kind of scripted and wrote that they you know, they predict that though being a doctor and being a lawyer could be replaced by by AI stuff in the not too distant future, but</p>
<p class="body">This process of regenerative farming is a really creative endeavor like your problem solving constantly and</p>
<p class="body">People have a tendency to relegate these farmers as just kind of look like inbred idiots, and they're not that smart like there's an enormous amount of information that they have to learn about their local situation and what they're doing</p>
<p class="body">And again constant problem solving, so this could be one of these things that revitalizes Middle America and is a</p>
<p class="body">Really long term, you know job and employment and economic engine is having people do more of this type of work</p>
<p class="body">Like there was a time when more people worked in agrarian settings and then we shifted into urban centers, and maybe there's a case to be made that more people need to shift back into a a quasi agrarian setting both for the employment but also for like the quality of life and the production about food</p>
<p class="body">And different things like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and I was just going to add two</p>
<p class="body">You know the vegan dialogue works really well for like Norwegian billionaires and Bill Gates</p>
<p class="body">And people that can afford it, and they've got a Whole Foods nearby where they can get their goji berries and coconut oil and all those things</p>
<p class="body">But for the majority of people they want me</p>
<p class="body">They want to be able to eat it, and now we've got even science so corrupted that</p>
<p class="body">People are trying to pull it away from people and so it's</p>
<p class="body">When you look at the nutritional ramifications of what happens when people have less animal source foods</p>
<p class="body">It's not, it's it's a social justice issue</p>
<p class="body">It's an equity of food equity problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is what was the motivation for demonising me? </p>
<p class="body">Other than I mean we know about the the studies that were done, that the sugar industry funded that demonize saturated fat which is really when you know about those studies, I, I believe was in 1960s, right? </p>
<p class="body">Where they were saying that saturated fat was the cause of all this heart disease and they were trying to take the blame off of sugar</p>
<p class="body">They they only bribed these guys with like $50,000, which is crazy because those findings. So this is pre Internet obviously</p>
<p class="body">That swept through the whole country and everybody terrified of saturated fat and people started drinking low fat milk and low fat</p>
<p class="body">This and low fat, fat and</p>
<p class="body">Everybody got fatter. It's it's really wild. If you look at the difference in like people that lived in 1960s and 1970s</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">For people today like you've seen, all those photos of people on the beach from the 1970s versus people today. It's crazy, the difference and some of that has to be attributable to diet. So with</p>
<p class="body">When we were saying science has been corrupted like what what happened? </p>
<p class="body">What's the motivation if they know this? </p>
<p class="body">We know, I know this, like I'm I'm not an expert</p>
<p class="body">How the **** do I know this that I would think that people study food science know this too and they would want to get that word out like hey this is not real like that's not what the problem is</p>
<p class="body">Not saturated fat</p>
<p class="body">The problem is not cholesterol</p>
<p class="body">In fact cholesterol is like the building blocks</p>
<p class="body">For a lot of hormones, and it's very important to you know cellular development, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean</p>
<p class="body">Bill Melinda Gates Foundation are one of the from what I understand or one of the big donors to this global burden of disease</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So do you think it's a financial incentive? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">There's a I mean who benefits from meat being bad? </p>
<p class="body">Big oil, because now it's not an industrial problem, it's a consumers problem, right? </p>
<p class="body">Just like recycling like put it on the consumer</p>
<p class="body">It's not the company making the plastic bottles, it's the consumer right? </p>
<p class="body">So we've got big oil benefits</p>
<p class="body">The Ultra processed food industry benefits not only because they're the ones making this junk, but also it takes the blame off</p>
<p class="body">All the cereals and pasta meals and all that stuff and</p>
<p class="body">Puts it on meat</p>
<p class="body">So they're winning</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It it in the book and I I always forget what's in the book and what's in the film</p>
<p class="body">But you dug into like the history of it</p>
<p class="body">Interestingly, like 7th Day Adventists, vegetarianism</p>
<p class="body">They they kind of founded the dietetics profession, so it had a very strong vegetarian underpinning to it because the the religious you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Meanings of the 7th Day Adventists, so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They founded dietetics</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And nursing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So a religion founded nursing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, you know, like Loma Linda University</p>
<p class="body">So I mean, they're they're</p>
<p class="body">They're operating within science, but it definitely had this</p>
<p class="body">Vegetarian orientation to it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And So what? Why has there in the cattle industry is huge? The beef industry is huge. There's 95% of the planet. Eats meat, right? Isn't it something high like that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but the</p>
<p class="body">The margins are really small though, because meat is such a commodity</p>
<p class="body">It's like steak is steak is steak, but beyond burger they can</p>
<p class="body">Their margins are amazing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What's new</p>
<p class="body">They're new, I like</p>
<p class="body">Is this an UN organization thing like did the the the beef people do they not know the existential threat to their existence? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Really, it's weird, it's weird</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, they're out there shoveling **** and oblivious</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, because they're not part of the coastal dialogue</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Ah, and I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">That's anti meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Some of it too is most of the players that own the meat production</p>
<p class="body">They they they own like the the grain</p>
<p class="body">You know the corn and and everything it because it's all consolidated, so they're like</p>
<p class="body">Well, maybe we'll lose a little bit there, but we'll make</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It up here and and they're major investors in the plant based meat as well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Not really</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">The meat, the large meat Packers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just for money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Diversify, why not? </p>
<p class="body">You're going to win either way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh crimeny</p>
<p class="body">So when you wrote this book</p>
<p class="body">Did you think that there was going to be major pushback? </p>
<p class="body">Did you think that you know you'd basically shored up all your arguments with with data and solid discussion? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I thought there was going to be more pushback from like the vegan side of the house and there hasn't been a huge amount</p>
<p class="body">And I we did</p>
<p class="body">We we tried to</p>
<p class="body">We really even in the point you know like is pastured meat more nutritionally superior to</p>
<p class="body">We really like like we, we had a discussion I'm like do we just lie about this? </p>
<p class="body">Because it would be great</p>
<p class="body">Then, like everything is consistent but</p>
<p class="body">One I think the ethics are dodgy there and then two</p>
<p class="body">It's a, you know</p>
<p class="body">One vegan doctor goes through our work and he looks at and he's like no, there's a difference there</p>
<p class="body">And if you can point out one glaring error like that, then it calls into question everything else</p>
<p class="body">So we really like whether it hurt or not</p>
<p class="body">We tried to be as honest with this stuff as as we could and what we have noticed is that</p>
<p class="body">We kind of uniformly **** everybody off</p>
<p class="body">Like almost nobody comes away reading that book and they feel just super happy and invigorated because it it it it</p>
<p class="body">It filled up the buckets of, like their preconceived notions like if you were really, really, really excited about regenerative AG, we we</p>
<p class="body">We sing the praises of that, but also we're not</p>
<p class="body">We're kind of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not black and white</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not totally black and white</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It doesn't have to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, like we make the case that like there's all these other foods that could be nutrient upcycled</p>
<p class="body">That doesn't really fit into like the grass Fed model so</p>
<p class="body">Why don't we take advantage of that? </p>
<p class="body">So it it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's been interesting like the areas that we've had some pushback in</p>
<p class="body">The most aggressive pushback is actually been the the really meet elitist kind of pastured meat scene because there are people out there that say it should be grass fed meat or nothing and it's like well that's interesting</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">They're not understanding the nutritional importance and how that dialogue, grass fed or nothing ends up with New York City schools going vegan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, the grass fed or nothing thing that sort of</p>
<p class="body">That the ideology is that is that oriented in like a nutrition standpoint, like why do they? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is there a nature thing? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">An environmentalist and ethical thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and so they cannot tolerate the idea</p>
<p class="body">That protein period is important</p>
<p class="body">We don't have enough regenerative meat to feed everybody</p>
<p class="body">We've got kids who, if they just got enough meat</p>
<p class="body">In a disadvantaged situation, they actually might have a leg</p>
<p class="body">Up so we should just be feeding them the meat that's available right now instead of waiting for the whole world to go grass fed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now who? </p>
<p class="body">Who's responsible for making meatless Monday and and no meat Friday in these school systems? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">So meatless Monday is partially funded by Beyond Burger</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh God</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And Johns Hopkins, which is a very anti meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now why are they anti meat? </p>
<p class="body">I'm just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know if they have some kind</p>
<p class="body">Of religious background</p>
<p class="body">I mean, Harvard is also</p>
<p class="body">Walter Willett is very anti meat and he's funded by Barila</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's because anti anti meat equals woke right like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Most a lot of it, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's part of part of what? </p>
<p class="body">The ideology is today</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And then the vegan Fridays is Mayor Adams Mayor Eric Adams</p>
<p class="body">I actually have a public letter on that, so I started an organization called the Global Food Justice Alliance where I'm trying to advocate for</p>
<p class="body">The inclusion of animal source foods for people, and I have a public letter out to Mayor Adams on all the points</p>
<p class="body">Why this is a horrible idea</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you know he's not really vegan? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">He has been questioned right about like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Spent pot eating fish</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And he says I have a plant based life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The restaurants</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Whenever he is questioned and he's like I want to get into the new ones and the vegan Friday thing is just I have a photograph actually that I sent over in the drop box of what the vegan Friday lunch looks like the burrito</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, I see</p>
<p class="body">It's so sad looking oh so sad looking</p>
<p class="body">School lunch looks</p>
<p class="body">Like **** already, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">But taking meat away and and if you think about the context for these kids in New York, right? </p>
<p class="body">There if you</p>
<p class="body">Tell them meat is bad, they're just going to go to subway and get a a sandwich without meat on it</p>
<p class="body">It's not like they're going to get</p>
<p class="body">A tofu bowl somewhere</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">And so you know, the top kid foods that kids love it</p>
<p class="body">Mac and cheese, burgers, pizza</p>
<p class="body">And chicken Nuggets</p>
<p class="body">And I would argue</p>
<p class="body">The meat part of those is the best part, and so if you tell these kids meat is bad</p>
<p class="body">Then they're just going to</p>
<p class="body">Pull the meat parts out and just eat the fries instead and the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Coke when when a child is growing, do they have different needs per kilogram in terms of like the amount of protein that they need? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, and they really. We have major problems even in developed countries. In the US with iron deficiency, which is one of the major things you need for growth for your brain and for physical growth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So the biggest pushback that you guys got was from the agriculture or from the grass fed people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">Kind of the</p>
<p class="body">But what you would call the meat elitist? </p>
<p class="body">We had lots of people in the pastured scene that were very gracious towards the book and thankful and everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Moving past</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">But there there's kind of a weird cross section of like the health influencers that say grass fed or nothing and then also kind of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What do? </p>
<p class="body">Basing that on 'cause I've said that, I've said that because I read it 'cause I read it that it was hiring essential fatty acids is better for you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so they don't like it when I say that, because then that takes part of their argument away</p>
<p class="body">It's an emotional decision</p>
<p class="body">It's not a logical decision</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">I've said that I'm probably one of the people that that like released that like syphilis on a college campus, and then I did something crazy and they really thoroughly got in and vetted the science</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You probably told me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">And it was like it</p>
<p class="body">It's not that simple like there's great ethical considerations for it</p>
<p class="body">They're really, really sound environmental reasons</p>
<p class="body">But when you just</p>
<p class="body">But up against just that nutrition piece, it it's just not the same compelling story on meat by itself</p>
<p class="body">Again, like the dairy eggs seafood, huge differences there, but just not the same</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">With me and there's a lot of very large family foundations that are</p>
<p class="body">Funding a lot of this grass fed stuff and they it's a very progressive</p>
<p class="body">Platform that they're taking, and so to say that meat is healthy, period</p>
<p class="body">It's all of a sudden I'm on the right and and like not aligning with their politics and this should be a bipartisan I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">I am totally apolitical on all this stuff, but I'm immediately tagged as</p>
<p class="body">A troublemaker if I say the meat is healthy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We are</p>
<p class="body">So many problems with that in this country where people get so dogmatic and they're so connected to their ideology that they they don't even question anything that goes outside of it</p>
<p class="body">And this sort of healthy questioning and just reasoning and logic and just looking at data and looking at information and challenging your own personal assumptions</p>

<p class="body">It's so rare</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's so rare</p>
<p class="body">I mean, maybe you get one or two percent of the people</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what the numbers are</p>
<p class="body">Who like look at their diet and look at their life and then look</p>
<p class="body">At things like this and read a book like that and go hey</p>
<p class="body">Maybe I should try this, like maybe I'm like too rigid with this</p>
<p class="body">This philosophy that I've adopted that plant based is the only thing that's good for the heart and protects the environment</p>
<p class="body">And you want to be a good person</p>
<p class="body">That's the way to go</p>
<p class="body">You know it's it's just so rare</p>
<p class="body">Most people they get something in their head and they just stick with that</p>
<p class="body">And then there</p>
<p class="body">Echo Chamber that they exist in that that reinforces and supports that, and that's all they ever talk about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and there's a</p>
<p class="body">I mean there's a lot of very large</p>
<p class="body">Interests that are pushing the plant based narrative and then they have this grassroots army of ethical</p>
<p class="body">Cheerleaders that are just backing them up for free and then on our end</p>
<p class="body">It's so complicated to be able to talk about the environmental piece like we have health influencers that understand the nutrition piece, but they can't</p>
<p class="body">Really articulate all the environment and then you throw ethics in there and then environmental people don't fully appreciate the nutritional pieces that meat is good, period</p>
<p class="body">And so you end up with nobody really advocating for me</p>
<p class="body">And also there's no money in</p>
<p class="body">Advocating for me</p>
<p class="body">It just it just creates the headache</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They've just made that idea, so it's so prevalent that meat is bad for you</p>
<p class="body">Meat is bad for your heart, high cholesterol, bad for the environment</p>
<p class="body">You're a bad person</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">That's why we call the book sacred</p>
<p class="body">Cow, because it's just this</p>
<p class="body">Unquestioned truth that cows are bad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And where's the documentary? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It's on Amazon only on Amazon</p>
<p class="body">It's on iTunes and like all those like video on demand type things I couldn't even give it to Netflix</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They wouldn't take it really</p>
<p class="body">They probably have some funky deal with like some vegan programming</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4> 
<p class="body">You know it's worth mentioning the folks that public we were turned down from every single publisher</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah</p>
<p class="body">No would take this book</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4>

<p class="body">We're diversifying, sort of like the meat</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Robb Wolf </h4>

<p class="body">Least needs to be told</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What was the rejection when you guys got rejected? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Diana Rodgers </h4> 
<p class="body">It was always a different answer from like that's when you know it's not really your fault, but like it was a different reason like I think that this is already been told</p>

<p class="body">I think that this isn't going to sell</p>
<p class="body">And then and then the weird thing is probably just COVID, but we would have made the New York Times list well, if the New York Times wanted to put us on the list</p>

<p class="body">We should be eating meat</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Red meat is now worse for us in our minds than fat ever could have been, because there are so many more reasons to avoid red meat, not only for your health but also now for the goodness of others, including not killing animals</p>

<p class="body">Now is to do it</p>
<p class="body">Well, that is the only</p>
