<p class="body">The Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p class="body">Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by Night, all day.</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's been Oliver Stone's thing. I mean, he's been following that story. He's been chasing it down. We talked about on the podcast that his film JFK was essentially 30 years after the assassination. And then this documentary that he just released his 30 years after his film. So he's been chasing this thing. Now it's very good. It's very good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Chase, I should catch the documentary I've seen I've seen the film I should watch</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's on Showtime</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean generally where we're life, right? We're a composer, so generally the assassination of President's. It's something which</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">You know I've been in prison with people that assassinated, said that, and it's just yeah, these sorts of this intrigue</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, really</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The top and the plots</p>
<p class="body">I actually befriended them</p>
<p class="body">I've got a copy of the of the Quran at home signed by one of them as a gift to me about parting gift from from prison</p>
<p class="body">But the kind of intrigue when you get to that level of intrigue at the top, nothing is ever what it seems, man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I can only imagine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It seems you know</p>

<p class="body">It's got to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Be a stressful way to live</p>
<p class="body">Imagine being</p>
<p class="body">A world leader? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, of course</p>
<p class="body">And all the the **** you're dealing with and potential assassination and coup plots and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And and part of how you operate has to be one thing, one face you present to the public, and another thing is what you're really actually doing, because you've got all these other people, especially today with the nature of information wars, attempting to subvert what you're trying to do</p>
<p class="body">Based on your over actions and so you have to truly hide what you're really actually up to, you know it's it's difficult to navigate that terrain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, not only that, but when you operate like that, if you're constantly operating in this sort of deception vein</p>
<p class="body">Like it's got to be hard to know what's true and what's not true because you're kind of you're full of **** when you're full of **** I think it becomes more difficult to recognize what's true and what's not true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And you don't get to that position unless you're full</p>
<p class="body">Of **** in</p>
<p class="body">The first place you have to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So you compromise like they don't let you in, like when you find out politicians that aren't like $200,000 a year and you find out they're worth $200 million</p>
<p class="body">How did that happen? </p>
<p class="body">And you're like what is? </p>
<p class="body">Going on, well, I'll tell you what's going</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">On just look to Pelosi</p>
<p class="body">Right, yeah, well that was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I talking about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">She's making a lot of money</p>
<p class="body">It's wild, but it's not from</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Her salary</p>
<p class="body">Well, the my favorite thing was when she was confronted and they asked her a question about trading about whether or not you know people that are in Congress and what have you should be able to trade</p>
<p class="body">And she takes a sip water 'cause she knows this is going to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Be a big one</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know</p>
<p class="body">And well, listen there was a there was a on Twitter</p>
<p class="body">And we can probably return to the question of tech and and speech and censorship</p>
<p class="body">But there was this account called Pelosi Tracker</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if you ever saw it now</p>
<p class="body">It's been taken down</p>
<p class="body">It was tracking all her traits</p>
<p class="body">I was following the damn thing</p>
<p class="body">I was really interested to learn from</p>
<p class="body">It you know it's good to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Invest, but she's investing in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">They took what? </p>
<p class="body">Because that's what they say, right? </p>
<p class="body">You watch you watch her moves and you</p>
<p class="body">Know you're gonna make money</p>
<p class="body">Why would they take it? It got taken down. There was 2/2 accounts. One was called Epstein tracker and it was following the GILLAIN trial</p>
<p class="body">Was it gillain tracker Epstein track? </p>
<p class="body">The other was Pelosi tracker</p>
<p class="body">Both got taken</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Down why? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Who knows, man? </p>
<p class="body">That's why does Twitter do anything? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Man, it's so confusing now</p>
<p class="body">I mean, Twitter used to be like you would remember the old days when you would just say like at mojid</p>
<p class="body">I'm having a pizza with friends like you know, like you would do those things like that's what people would do like off to the movies with my buddies</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a weapon now, yeah, it's it's a weapon in a hybrid war that we're in</p>
<p class="body">Unfortunately, we're in a hybrid war and one of the main fronts in that war is is information over the definition of reality, and in that context</p>
<p class="body">If you know whoever defines reality gets to win and Twitter is as a result in that context, it's a weapon that is being used to define reality by molding peoples minds</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's fascinating to put it that way, and what's interesting is the people that are being molded are fiercely defending the rights of those people to mold them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's the best way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">To do it right, well, the the the people who are being molded</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the people that are a part of the hive mind</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's the best way to do it</p>
<p class="body">I mean look if I wanted to enslave you, I don't think I'd have much of much of a chance physically, right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean I I</p>
<p class="body">I don't know about you, but I I've only been training for about couple of years</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so the way to do it would be for me to convince you</p>
<p class="body">Yes, use a Jedi mind trick</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, these are not the drones you're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah right, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Looking for droids</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So you voluntarily follow me</p>
<p class="body">That's the way to do it</p>
<p class="body">And if you're a minority in power, you're always going to be</p>
<p class="body">A minority, if you're in power</p>

<p class="body">I want it but when we get this conversation started and what I want to do for people that don't know you, I want to go into your past and you know and your book and who you were in a</p>
<p class="body">You know, in the previous life and who you are now and why you're recognizing this and you're so fiercely</p>
<p class="body">Resisting this **** more than a lot of</p>
<p class="body">Because a lot of people are scared of blowback like they see what's going on with governments and with lockdowns and all these things in there</p>
<p class="body">They're scared of the blowback, and so they're kind of keeping their mouth shut, but you're not doing that at all</p>
<p class="body">And I think a lot of that has to do with your past</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I've seen was yeah so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Will you just give us a like a rundown of what happened with you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So I</p>
<p class="body">For your listeners, I was born in Essex, UK and</p>
<p class="body">I had a very normal</p>
<p class="body">Childhood until I kind of hit my teenage years</p>
<p class="body">From my teenagers, we were the first generation by the way of Muslims born and raised in the West. My parents were immigrants and why that why that's relevant is we my age group. Now I'm 44. We had to navigate a place for Muslims in the West</p>
<p class="body">Prior to that point, of course</p>
<p class="body">That hadn't been done, and there's a long history with sort of this whole Huntington model of a clash of civilizations, which is a bit caricature, but there's a long history sort of between Islam and the West and and relations and and mixing some of it's good, a lot of it involved</p>
<p class="body">War with the Crusades that we're now born and raised in the West as British citizens</p>
<p class="body">Now to put that into context, in Europe</p>
<p class="body">If you look with the US and you have minority communities, a lot of the</p>
<p class="body">Room for improvement exists in, say, African American communities, right in Europe</p>
<p class="body">The equivalent is with Muslim communities</p>
<p class="body">Wherever you go, whether it's in Britain with Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, whether it's in France with the North Africans in Morocco</p>
<p class="body">In the Netherlands with N Africans, Moroccans in Germany with Turks</p>
<p class="body">Across Europe, generally Albanians, who also majority happen to be Muslim but more cultural</p>
<p class="body">Not really that religious, but across Europe the the largest minorities are Muslims and so that same question about</p>
<p class="body">Integration cooperation</p>
<p class="body">Equal opportunities social mobility</p>
<p class="body">Whereas in the US it applies specifically I don't know, say for example with African Americans and Mexican Americans or Latino Americans in the in the in Europe generally and in the UK</p>
<p class="body">It's a Muslim question</p>
<p class="body">So when I began sort of hit my teenage years, we experienced a lot of tension around that and there was a lot of racist violence that I experienced growing up with some sort of neo-Nazi racist violence</p>
<p class="body">And when I say violence, I'm talking severe severe shift like machete and hammer attacks, screwdriver attacks</p>
<p class="body">I've had to watch friends of mine get stabbed</p>
<p class="body">Before the age of 16, many of my friends stabbed</p>
<p class="body">We had running street fights with these guys, knives, machetes, everything</p>
<p class="body">I mean it was like a it was really bad</p>
<p class="body">One particular occasion this guy tried to help me</p>
<p class="body">I was surrounded by a group of them and they all had their big kebab knives</p>
<p class="body">I thought I was going to die man and then this this guy was just walking past random guy walking past</p>
<p class="body">He saw that I was surrounded by these guys and he tried to step in to defend me</p>
<p class="body">And what they did is they asked 15 years old they</p>
<p class="body">Held me back and they basically started stabbing this guy all over his</p>
<p class="body">Body force me to watch it and they called him a pokie lover</p>
<p class="body">Oh, and the idea was that he's a traitor to his skin for trying to defend me</p>
<p class="body">So of course I became very angry</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but by the way, I I met that guy about two years ago he lived</p>

<p class="body">She lived</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">He had a punctured lung</p>
<p class="body">Turns out he was with the army</p>
<p class="body">He's a hero for me man</p>
<p class="body">He's a hero and I put out a public appeal to see if I could get reunited with him</p>
<p class="body">He wants to stay anonymous, but I met him</p>
<p class="body">And he's still alive, and he's still still lives in the in my hometown and he's still, you know, local to the area in my home county</p>
<p class="body">But that made me very angry at the same time, if you want to think back the time frame we're talking about the early 90s, the genocide in Bosnia was happening</p>
<p class="body">The Bosnians are also Muslim</p>
<p class="body">And so we we felt that that could come to Britain</p>
<p class="body">We felt very isolated</p>
<p class="body">We felt very</p>
<p class="body">Very vulnerable, and so we were looking in that context for some form of belonging</p>
<p class="body">Feeling rejected from those from society around us</p>
<p class="body">The guys that the guys that attacked us by the way they would boast about having connections and links with the police</p>
<p class="body">And it turns out to be the case that that there was a problem in those days with the police</p>
<p class="body">There's a famous case of the murder of Stephen Lawrence in the UK</p>
<p class="body">Who was stabbed to death in a similar way while waiting at a bus stop and his killers were never brought to justice for over 20 years? </p>
<p class="body">And there was a government inquiry commissioned into that</p>
<p class="body">It's called the MacPherson inquiry, and it eventually became famous for coining that phrase institutional racism</p>
<p class="body">And it was talking about how police were not looking into these sorts of crimes, so nobody was ever brought to justice for what happened to us</p>
<p class="body">And everything I described was a year before Stephen Lawrence was murdered, but that became the pivotal case in the UK</p>
<p class="body">It became like a George Floyd might because of huge, except he wasn't that, you know, I know</p>
<p class="body">George Floyd had some background this guy had</p>
<p class="body">He was clean</p>
<p class="body">It's just a a young kid, no background</p>
<p class="body">He just set a bus stop</p>
<p class="body">So in that context, we became very angry and we began looking for belonging and identity outside of the mainstream that we felt rejected us, and so at the age of 16, why that's all relevant? </p>
<p class="body">I ended up joining a revolutionary Islamist organization I didn't trust society</p>
<p class="body">I didn't trust authority</p>
<p class="body">I didn't trust the West generally</p>
<p class="body">Looking at the genocide in Bosnia with the UN troops, one of the</p>
<p class="body">The most searing memories for me was that Srebrenica, where the UN, the Dutch, UN soldiers were standing by as as the Bosnian Muslims were killed and putting that mass grave and they didn't have the mandate to intervene</p>
<p class="body">So we really didn't trust institutions to defend us, whether it was foreign policy or even domestic at home</p>
<p class="body">So at the age of 16, I joined this group called has Barrier</p>
<p class="body">Which means the party of liberation</p>
<p class="body">And it's in a nutshell</p>
<p class="body">The before al Qaeda and definitely before ISIS</p>
<p class="body">This was an organization that wanted a caliphate globally around the world</p>
<p class="body">But instead of using terrorism in the conventional means, we understand it today</p>
<p class="body">Blowing things up, our purpose, our method was to recruit army officers in Muslim majority countries and instigate military coups</p>
<p class="body">To try and come to power</p>
<p class="body">I joined this group at 16</p>
<p class="body">And I spent about a decade</p>
<p class="body">Well yeah, more just over a decade in this organization, I rose to the leadership in the UK</p>
<p class="body">I set the group I exported it from the UK and set it up in Pakistan</p>
<p class="body">It was part of the first move in the way that went from Britain to Pakistan to found the group there in that</p>
<p class="body">In that vein, I ended up recruiting some army officers there</p>
<p class="body">In Pakistan as well, can I ask you how that happens? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How do you? </p>
<p class="body">How do you make contact with the army officers and how could you recruit them and like how? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Would you go about doing that? </p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, there's this Military Academy in the UK that globally countries send their officers to for</p>
<p class="body">The training it's called Sandhurst</p>
<p class="body">And we would because of the Pakistani community</p>
<p class="body">We knew friends who had relatives or whatever that would be coming from Pakistan to study at Sandhurst</p>
<p class="body">It's a, it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's like an officers training Academy and then through relatives</p>
<p class="body">You know you get begin conversation</p>
<p class="body">And then really the rest of it is what's what's really important is being trained</p>
<p class="body">In in techniques as to how to convince people of your aim</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So like what he what would? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So a lot of that involves around first, so we used to say that you have to first destroy before you build, and so whatever you believe in at the moment has to be removed before we can replace it with our ideological framework</p>
<p class="body">And so if you believe in, say, you're coming from Pakistan, a thing you're going to generally</p>
<p class="body">Obviously there are exceptions, but you're going to have</p>
<p class="body">Some form of belief in the international order in the international system in democratic governance</p>
<p class="body">Because Pakistan</p>
<p class="body">For most of its history has been a democracy</p>
<p class="body">And so we'd have to pick apart those ideas first by focusing on the floors and the holes in these sites</p>
<p class="body">So take the international community. Very easy to do if you've got the UN standing by while a genocide is going on in Bosnia and you're speaking to a Muslim who's from a country that was founded to protect Muslims after partition in 1947. And you know, just say look, you think</p>
<p class="body">Do you think these institutions are going to protect you when you see what happened in Bosnia, so the failure of the international order or something that we could poke to try and make that you know, make those fissures bigger? </p>
<p class="body">And so a lot of it is, and we'll get back to this by the way, with the debate today with COVID, but a lot of it was a psychological assault on assumptions that people took for granted and then you pick those apart</p>
<p class="body">Through discussion, you demonstrate how how those assumptions don't stand up to the real world, and they require a solution</p>
<p class="body">That solution has to be something that fits what the person wants</p>
<p class="body">Now, if you're speaking to a Muslim, it's pretty much a given that they don't want genocide against Muslims</p>
<p class="body">So we'd go back, say, take the example of Bosnia</p>
<p class="body">We talk about</p>
<p class="body">Well, how do you think Muslims who are blonde hair blue-eyed even came to Bosnia in the first place? </p>
<p class="body">Well, it actually it was through the caliphate, which is true</p>
<p class="body">It was the Ottomans had to, you know, have the leadership of the Muslim world at the time</p>
<p class="body">Modern day Turkey</p>
<p class="body">And the Ottomans used to provide protection in that area. Now that last vestige of a caliphate was destroyed in 1924 after World War One</p>
<p class="body">And that's when the Muslims who are in modern day Bosnia are lost</p>
<p class="body">That protection of the Ottoman Empire</p>
<p class="body">So if you're speaking to somebody that knows his history, which we were trained in, so remember I'm 16, I shouldn't be having conversations about the Ottoman Empire in Bosnia, unless somehow I've been, you know, I've been involved in a form of a a process of a combination of education and indoctrination, and it's how to use that education for the purposes of indoctrination that we were trained in</p>
<p class="body">So you kind of have those discussions and we ended up recruiting people</p>
<p class="body">As I say, I exported it to Denmark, then to Pakistan</p>
<p class="body">I was on the leadership in the UK eventually</p>
<p class="body">I went to Egypt to try and reestablish the group there in Egypt, Egypt</p>
<p class="body">At the time was under Hosni Mubarak</p>
<p class="body">I was doing a degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies</p>
<p class="body">It's so as part of the University of London</p>
<p class="body">It's considered one of the leading</p>
<p class="body">Kind of radical, left wing colleges in the UK, but for Arabic it's actually one of the best in the in in the world</p>
<p class="body">And I was doing law in Arabic and so I see</p>
<p class="body">And for my Arabic degree I needed to go to an Arab country for my language</p>
<p class="body">Here my third year, so I chose Egypt</p>
<p class="body">So that was my ostensible reason for going to Egypt, but actually, while I was there, I began recruiting again for my organization</p>
<p class="body">The difference between Egypt and Pakistan, Denmark and Britain</p>
<p class="body">Is Egypt a dictatorship still is till today? </p>
<p class="body">Whereas Pakistan wasn't</p>
<p class="body">And course, Denmark and Britain won so</p>
<p class="body">In Egypt, where I tried to stop, you know, start building these cells, recruit people to my organization</p>
<p class="body">I arrived one day before the 9/11 attacks, not knowing of course that was happening</p>
<p class="body">And so that that changed the security paradigm for the whole world</p>
<p class="body">If you remember Bush saying that sorry Tony Blair saying the rules of the game have changed</p>
<p class="body">Once 911 happened, people like us who were not</p>
<p class="body">You know, terrorists in the kind of bombing sense, right? </p>
<p class="body">So I, that's just the difference between, say, an Islamist to briefly define it</p>
<p class="body">Somebody who wants to impose a version of Islam over society as opposed to just the religion of Islam, which is a faith and Islamist I define and people can differ with these definitions</p>
<p class="body">Just my definition</p>
<p class="body">Someone who wants to impose a version of Islam over society</p>
<p class="body">Impose a dogma, yeah</p>
<p class="body">But on methods on means were not violent, they were more like infiltrating the government and trying to take over from within</p>
<p class="body">But once the 9/11 attacks happened, the security kind of rules of the game changed. The Egyptian regime came after us</p>
<p class="body">There was a bit of a a cat and mouse chase</p>
<p class="body">I was on the run for a bit in Egypt, but eventually they raided my house at sort of roughly 3:00 AM and they had to machine guns and grenades and they came in and I was awake at the time because I had</p>
<p class="body">I was married and I had a one year old</p>
<p class="body">I have a one year old</p>
<p class="body">He was one at the time I I have a son from that previous marriage</p>
<p class="body">And I was trying to put him back to sleep</p>
<p class="body">They ripped him from my arms</p>
<p class="body">They blindfolded me</p>
<p class="body">And they put me in this van</p>
<p class="body">Took me to that state security headquarters and the a lot of I can go into some of the detail, but a lot of atrocities then happen to us</p>
<p class="body">I mean we</p>
<p class="body">Were we went through quite a horrific experience in the dungeons of Egypt and the first thing they did is they took me up in Alexandria where I was living</p>
<p class="body">They took me up to the top of a building blindfolding and stood me on the edge of the of the roof</p>
<p class="body">To try and make me believe that they're going to push me over, I had to stand there very still to see if it, you know</p>
<p class="body">It takes a bit of</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it takes a bit out</p>
<p class="body">You don't use it</p>
<p class="body">You can't see anything</p>
<p class="body">It's standing at the and I could feel the wind around me, but that was just a warm up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh Jesus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That was for the purpose of softening me up so that I could</p>
<p class="body">I would believe that they're prepared to do anything so that I'm ready to talk</p>
<p class="body">So once they put me there then they took me down and they took me into an up to see an officer</p>
<p class="body">See an officer</p>
<p class="body">I was blindfolded but to to be confronted by an intelligence officer from the state security</p>
<p class="body">And he asked me my story and we were trained to say one thing in that context, as Islamist revolutionaries and the answer was very straightforward, and it's what I said, I I was</p>
<p class="body">Very programmed right? </p>
<p class="body">So I said my name is Majid Nawaz and I'm a member of his media from Britain</p>
<p class="body">And that's all I got to say to you</p>
<p class="body">And that's what I said to the officer</p>
<p class="body">So he laughed and</p>
<p class="body">He he's heard that before from us there's a long history of this group in Egypt</p>
<p class="body">So he said, alright, let's see what you do next and then they put us in this van</p>
<p class="body">Drove us through the desert, still blindfolded</p>
<p class="body">Took us to a Cairo</p>
<p class="body">And they took us to the this building called Algiers</p>
<p class="body">It has a dollar which is the headquarters of the state security internal state security for all of Egypt took us underground</p>
<p class="body">And this is where the real nightmare began</p>
<p class="body">Tired our hands behind our backs with rags</p>
<p class="body">We were bodies piled on top of each other on the floor</p>
<p class="body">In this I don't know what it was</p>
<p class="body">I call it a dungeon 'cause it was underground in a basement like structure</p>
<p class="body">And then that's when the screaming began. They they gave us all numbers. I was 42</p>
<p class="body">And from from</p>
<p class="body">From that day when we were at</p>
<p class="body">This is now I think day 2</p>
<p class="body">From that evening they began A roll call</p>
<p class="body">We weren't allowed to sleep</p>
<p class="body">By the way, if we slept and we didn't answer our name, we were beaten</p>
<p class="body">And they bit they went through the numbers in chronological order</p>
<p class="body">And so I would hear number one</p>
<p class="body">He was called up, taken into a separate room, tortured, and we would hear his screams electrocuted</p>
<p class="body">And then they'd say call number 2</p>
<p class="body">Number one is brought back, collapses in his spot, brings the number 2 #3 and they go through. Everyone is being tortured 1 by 1</p>
<p class="body">And of course I have to wait my turn 42 so I have heard 41 other people so #41 is next to me</p>
<p class="body">Is this is a is a moment I write about in radical, which is the story of all of this</p>
<p class="body">It's My Autobiography is called radical</p>
<p class="body">And this poor guy</p>
<p class="body">I just don't know who he is till this day</p>
<p class="body">But he turned to me and he was crying 'cause he's he's turn was next</p>
<p class="body">And he said help me</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what to do</p>
<p class="body">I mean I'm in the same position so I just read some passages of the answer him</p>
<p class="body">There's a there's</p>
<p class="body">A passage about a boy because Muslims believe everything you know in the old and New Testament</p>
<p class="body">We believe that's from the same tradition, the same God and a bit like the best way I can explain it for an American or a world audience</p>
<p class="body">Just as Christianity views Judaism as part of their tradition, Islam views Christianity and Judaism as part of our tradition, right? </p>
<p class="body">So there's a story in the Quran about a Christian boy who tried to proselytize for monotheism</p>
<p class="body">And this Pagan king didn't like him, and he put him in a ditch and he burned everyone in this ditch</p>
<p class="body">It's called Surat al Burooj</p>
<p class="body">The story of the trench</p>
<p class="body">And it's about suffering in the face of truth</p>
<p class="body">And so I just started reciting this passage to him whatsoever till Brujah started reciting this passage</p>
<p class="body">And there's a very specific way of reciting the Quran</p>
<p class="body">It soothed him all</p>
<p class="body">I remember him saying to me was you're a good man, thank you</p>
<p class="body">And then he was taking his number was called</p>
<p class="body">He was taken</p>
<p class="body">And then eventually he was he collapsed, he was brought back and he was just unconscious and my number was called</p>
<p class="body">So I had to walk and imagine that I had to walk towards this</p>
<p class="body">The room where they're going to torture me and</p>
<p class="body">The guy said, right, you're going to have to speak</p>
<p class="body">And I still had my hands tide behind my my back</p>
<p class="body">But I had managed to get the rags loose and I'm not the kind of guy that's gonna</p>
<p class="body">I mean I</p>
<p class="body">I honestly I at that moment I decided I'd rather die than be humiliated in this way and and then also then</p>
<p class="body">Telling him a story about my friends, you know</p>
<p class="body">So because my hands were loose, so I honestly I decided I'd rather just attack the guy and they're gonna have to shoot me dead</p>
<p class="body">But then something unexpected happened</p>
<p class="body">There were four of us from the UK</p>
<p class="body">Instead of electrocuting me, he electrocuted my friend who was also in the group with me</p>
<p class="body">Who's from London who was also in Egypt</p>
<p class="body">They tortured him in front of me</p>
<p class="body">And then he said, right your turn, you have to speak</p>
<p class="body">Tell us why you're here</p>
<p class="body">Tell us what you're doing here in Egypt</p>
<p class="body">I gave him the answer, I I the stock answer I gave in Alexandria</p>
<p class="body">So my name is Majid Nawaz</p>
<p class="body">I'm a member of his Victoria from Britain</p>
<p class="body">Do what you want</p>
<p class="body">And by this time my hands were loose, but I was still pretending they were still tired and honestly jolyne like people</p>
<p class="body">Don't think this is this is barbaric, but you haven't been in that situation to know what happens to the brain</p>
<p class="body">But I took the view that if they touched me, I'm just going to bite down on his neck and they're gonna have to shoot me dead</p>
'cause I was just going to basically just</p>
<p class="body">Just attack the guy with my teeth</p>
<p class="body">That's all I had</p>
<p class="body">Lucky for me</p>
<p class="body">For whatever reason, he said, right? I'm going to give you 24 more hours to think</p>
<p class="body">About your answer</p>
<p class="body">Go back to</p>
<p class="body">Your spot and</p>
<p class="body">If you if you don't answer, you saw what we did to your friend and we're going to do that to you now</p>
<p class="body">This is the 4th day, so they took me back to my place</p>
<p class="body">And then</p>
<p class="body">I was kind of there was some hints that</p>
<p class="body">They were going</p>
<p class="body">To rape me or whatever they're talking about</p>
<p class="body">Oh, this one looks, you know, talking about physical features and maybe we should treat it in a different way</p>
<p class="body">And then I think they were trying to scare me with that too</p>
<p class="body">And they they have, by the way, they they were raped</p>
<p class="body">They were ****** whipped wives in there they were torturing children in front of their fathers</p>
<p class="body">Just to try and force the father to confess</p>
<p class="body">I mean, there's just imagine no rules</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, anything is possible and nobody is ever going to find out about it</p>
<p class="body">Now lucky for me, that was the 4th day. The British Consul is meant to make contact within 48 hours, so four days they're already late</p>
<p class="body">But however they managed to do on that 4th day because I I was a student of Arabic and I could understand</p>
<p class="body">I heard a phone ring in the dungeon and one of the officers picked the phone up and I could hear him speaking in Arabic and he said, yeah, the foreigners are here with me</p>
<p class="body">And then I could hear him say yes, Sir, yes Sir</p>
<p class="body">OK, alright today Sir</p>
<p class="body">And that's when I realized that you know what we might be taking out of here</p>
<p class="body">So I it was it was the case</p>
<p class="body">On the that evening</p>
<p class="body">So I was due to go back to that officer and who'd given me the warning</p>
<p class="body">But before I was due back, they sent some pickup truck military truck to come and collect the four of us that were from the UK and they took us from there and I I imagine the ambassador was making a big stink</p>
<p class="body">They took us from there and instead took us to a prison called Masla or Prison, which is where I eventually met the assassins of unanswered</p>
<p class="body">At the former Prime Minister former president</p>
<p class="body">And they put us into solitary confinement for 3 1/2 months, roughly</p>
<p class="body">The Egyptians we left behind there the Egyptians continued</p>
<p class="body">They continued treating them in a really brutal way</p>
<p class="body">Those that were arrested with us</p>
<p class="body">But we were then put into solitary confinement</p>
<p class="body">I was then, as a result, I was never electrocuted my friend, as I said, was in front of me</p>
<p class="body">He was in the next cell to me</p>
<p class="body">And after so that cell that we were put into solitary confinement, there was not, there was no toilet, there was no bed, bedding or any</p>
<p class="body">It's just a bare concrete cell</p>
<p class="body">We had to</p>
<p class="body">Forgive me, but you know, I suppose this is your show</p>
<p class="body">We can speak like this, but we had to **** on the floor</p>
<p class="body">We had to **** on the floor and then they'd come 15 minutes break</p>
<p class="body">They come with a bucket</p>
<p class="body">And they just wash it down and then we're back on that in that same cell</p>
303 months or so later we were charged</p>
<p class="body">I remember the charges still in Arabic</p>
<p class="body">I still quote them for you, but the first charge was intimate, which means membership</p>
<p class="body">Lagemaat in rating of a prohibited organization</p>
<p class="body">The second charge was that we'd Bill Coley, will ketaba propagation by speech and writing of band ideas, and it was beautiful, because that's what convinced Anansi International to adopt us as prisoners of conscience the charges? </p>

<p class="body">Bad ideas</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Now why that's beautiful is imagine, by the way, I forgot to say. So I was 24 years old. By this time, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Imagine an angry Muslim 24 at the peak of the war</p>
<p class="body">On terror, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Iraq hadn't yet been invaded, but 911 had happened</p>
<p class="body">I hated the West</p>
<p class="body">I hated what I called the kuffar infidels</p>
<p class="body">And I existed to overthrow the Western order and I was prepared to die</p>
<p class="body">For that</p>
<p class="body">I was prepared to be tortured for it</p>
<p class="body">And along comes Amnesty International and they say he doesn't deserve to be in jail for his ideas unless he's committed a crime and we hadn't committed any crime in Egypt</p>
<p class="body">All we were doing was speaking about these ideas</p>
<p class="body">These kind of revolutionary ideas</p>
<p class="body">And because the Egyptian constitution had been suspended</p>
<p class="body">Under an emergency, since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981</p>
<p class="body">By the guys I eventually met in that same prison</p>
<p class="body">The Egyptian Constitution does protect ideas, but it had been suspended in the name of an emergency for over 20 years, and I'd like to when we get to the current day, come back to the the nature of how emergencies work</p>
<p class="body">When they suspend your rights</p>
<p class="body">OK, so this is they suspended the rights of Egyptians and it was meant to be temporary and that temporary situation lasted over 20 years</p>
<p class="body">Which is why we ended up in jail</p>
<p class="body">For our ideas, what was the? </p>
<p class="body">Initial emergency, the assassination of the president</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so because of that emergency they used that to justify</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Which I can assure you, assassinates assassinating a president is a lot more deadly than the Fr for COVID, which is 0.096% similar to the flu. So that was a real emergency where a president was killed</p>
<p class="body">And it was meant to be temporary</p>
<p class="body">The state of emergency existed for over 20 years</p>
<p class="body">It's why they were allowed to treat us in that way because they had suspended the rights of their citizens as a permanent thing</p>
<p class="body">Amnesty International comes along and says</p>
<p class="body">These guys are prisoners of conscience</p>
<p class="body">When I learned of that, it really really shook me</p>
<p class="body">I had never in my life up until that point and I'm 24. I never received the positive</p>
<p class="body">Word from any bastion of Western values, any institution, right? </p>
<p class="body">Whether it was amnesty, governments, media</p>
<p class="body">And it, and it began a process in me through in that time in prison to just try and understand why amnesty cared about defending my rights, because I knew I didn't care about them</p>
<p class="body">We would go around attempting to deconstruct the concept of human rights in order to recruit people to our ideological worldview, but here was this organization</p>
<p class="body">He knew that I defined them as a</p>
<p class="body">A soft power enemy</p>
<p class="body">We saw human rights organisations as a soft power tool of Western colonialism</p>
<p class="body">And so they knew I defined them as a intellectual enemy, and yet they were defending me in my right and attempting to help Get Me Out of jail</p>
<p class="body">So that began a process and I've said often, right where the heart leads, the mind can follow. So I think it's really important when you're trying to change people's minds and help people that they see an emotional connection first</p>
<p class="body">Because, and we've you know we've, we've seen this in science right? </p>
<p class="body">With neurological patterns I've often spoken to Sam Harris about this, that the often you look at the</p>
<p class="body">The way people think, and actually we think that we are led by our thoughts, but actually something happens in the brain prior to us</p>
<p class="body">Actually, even acknowledging what we're doing right so, and that brings up whole questions of free will that Sam talks about</p>
<p class="body">But here in this context, amnesty reaching out to me softened my heart for the first time in my life</p>
<p class="body">All I'd ever known up until that point</p>
<p class="body">In my relationship with the West and the country in which I was born</p>
<p class="body">Was violence</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I've seen more violence than anybody should have seen at that stage</p>
<p class="body">And that was the relationship I had my my relationship with society was defined through hate and violence, and that's all I've known through my adult years</p>
<p class="body">My teenage years and onto my early 20s</p>
<p class="body">We're in jail</p>
<p class="body">This is when Iraq got invaded by Blair and Bush and Blair</p>
<p class="body">Of course, we were really upset with that as Islamist prisoners</p>
<p class="body">We believe this is all part of the war that we were involved in, but amnesty continued campaigning for us</p>
<p class="body">So what I did is I spent we got eventually got convicted</p>
<p class="body">I I served five years</p>
<p class="body">Which in Egypt was meant to be 3/4 of the sentence. But we ended up staying for about four years in jail just under</p>
<p class="body">And we were released</p>
<p class="body">Having completed our full sentence</p>
<p class="body">So it's not that amnesty got us out, but the mere fact they were campaigning for us</p>
<p class="body">So I spent that time in prison</p>
<p class="body">Reading everything, I'll get my hands on</p>
<p class="body">We'll eventually let out of solitary confinement and die</p>
<p class="body">Always having been somebody that appreciated intellectual discussion</p>
<p class="body">I saw around me the who's who of political prisoners in Muslim Torah prison and we had everything from Communists and socialists</p>
<p class="body">We had Muslims who had converted to Christianity</p>
<p class="body">We had Christians, had converted to Islam</p>
<p class="body">We had jihadists who assassinated the President and we had Israeli spies who were being accused of being Israeli spies</p>
<p class="body">Everyone was in this jail</p>
<p class="body">Wow, and we had a joke that under Hosni Mubarak in Egypt</p>
<p class="body">If you change your mind from anything to anything as a criminal offense because it didn't make sense, right? </p>
<p class="body">You had a Muslim convert to Christianity, threw him in jail, Christian convert to Islam</p>
<p class="body">Of course, we were really upset with that as Islamist prisoners</p>
<p class="body">We believe this is all part of the war that we were involved in, but amnesty continued campaigning for us</p>
<p class="body">So what I did is I spent we got eventually got convicted</p>
<p class="body">And I served five years</p>
<p class="body">Which in Egypt was maybe 3/4 of the sentence, but we ended up staying for about four years in jail, just under</p>
<p class="body">And we were released</p>
<p class="body">Having completed our full sentence</p>
<p class="body">So it's not that amnesty got us out, but the mere fact they were campaigning for us</p>
<p class="body">So I spent that time in prison</p>
<p class="body">Reading everything, I'll get my hands on</p>
<p class="body">We'll eventually let out of solitary confinement and die</p>
<p class="body">Always having been somebody that appreciated intellectual discussion</p>
<p class="body">I swore around me the who's who of political prisoners in muscle after a prison and we had everything from Communists and socialists</p>
<p class="body">We had Muslims who had converted to Christianity</p>
<p class="body">We had Christians who converted to Islam</p>
<p class="body">We had jihadists who assassinated the president</p>
<p class="body">And we had Israeli spies who were being accused of being Israeli spies</p>
<p class="body">Everyone was in this jail, wow, and we had a joke that under Hosni Mubarak in Egypt</p>
<p class="body">If you change your mind from anything to anything as a criminal offence because it didn't make sense, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, Muslim converted to Christianity, threw him in jail</p>
<p class="body">Christian convert to Islam</p>
<p class="body">Throw him</p>
<p class="body">In jail for for conversion</p>
<p class="body">Everything any you change your mind on anything and you'd be</p>
<p class="body">In jail you're</p>
<p class="body">Unreliable, no? </p>
<p class="body">So you had jihadis</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What what was the logic? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's the that's The funny thing Mubarak didn't want anyone to think, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh wow</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Just don't think just obey</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So when he heard that you're just tossing and turning too much in your mind, you</p>
<p class="body">Just throw you in jail</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Throw you in jail that guy is too sketchy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Thrown in jail</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">About it, you got. You got people that are assassinated said that right? Yes why did they assassinate him in 1981? </p>
<p class="body">Monroe said that made a peace treaty with Israel, Egypt and Israel</p>
<p class="body">Peace is because of that President</p>
<p class="body">And and he</p>
<p class="body">And it was military guys that assassinated him</p>
<p class="body">And they did it because they believed that was treachery</p>
<p class="body">They didn't want peace with Israel, so assassinated him, right? </p>
<p class="body">So you can understand OK, you've got jihadis who believe making peace with Israel is treachery</p>
<p class="body">They're in jail, but on the other hand, this guy I was with in prison as well, and he's been accused of being an Israeli agent threw him</p>
<p class="body">In jail, two and the guys that prosecuted and convicted the assassins of Sadat</p>
<p class="body">Right, they were in jail with the assassins of Sadat 20 years later</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the danger of dictatorship</p>
'cause you literally can just point at anybody you want and go lock him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Everyone ends up in prison</p>
<p class="body">Up so I use that opportunity to speak to everyone</p>
<p class="body">I had the advantage that we were young</p>
<p class="body">They were like the the Sadat assassins had been in prison for longer than I've been alive. I was 24</p>
<p class="body">They'd been in jail 25 years, so we looked at them and thought wisdom. Now these guys had also changed their ideology</p>
<p class="body">In that time, they basically started advocating for a more peaceful approach and a more traditional faith in Islam as opposed to the politicized dogma</p>
<p class="body">What I called earlier Islamism</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so I spent a lot of time with these guys because first of all they had my respect</p>
<p class="body">They live the life that I had started on right? </p>
<p class="body">But they also then come back from it</p>
<p class="body">One he one of the their names was Doctor Tariq</p>
<p class="body">He managed to become a doctor through his time in prison and studying</p>
<p class="body">The other guy was</p>
<p class="body">So I spent a lot of time talking to them and others are Egypt largest jihadi group at the time was called Malice Lahmia</p>
<p class="body">Their leader was in prison as</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, what was their tipping point like once they were incarcerated after the assassination? </p>
<p class="body">What led them to change the way they viewed the world? </p>
<p class="body">I mean 'cause you would imagine that people</p>
<p class="body">One of the things that we always talk about with the prison system in America is you're just making making better criminals</p>
<p class="body">You're making more hardened criminals</p>
<p class="body">You're introducing them to other hardened criminals, and there's very little rehabilitation</p>
<p class="body">So what caused these men to change their perspective? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So this is that's the general rule and I'll get to in a second</p>
<p class="body">We eventually we also do</p>
<p class="body">That kind of rehabilitation work in the UK with Muslims convicted of high level terrorism</p>
<p class="body">In fact the brother, my friend who's who I'm working with and that was going to be here with me today</p>
<p class="body">But some paperwork didn't work out with his situation, so he's not but</p>
<p class="body">That it what happened in Egypt is the exception</p>
<p class="body">There was a process called Maraja at, which means the revisions and</p>
<p class="body">And they sent in a whole bunch of theologians to speak to the leaders of these jihadi groups</p>
<p class="body">And eventually over a process a long period, and I imagine a lot of carrot and stick</p>
<p class="body">The leadership of these groups, in particular the largest group, as I say, was known gammal Islamia, which is not the group that assassinated under us about the president that was known as AL Jihad in Islam or Islamic Jihad, but the other group which was larger was known as Gamal Islamia or the Islamic Group</p>
<p class="body">That groups leadership began</p>
<p class="body">This process of revision maraja at and eventually they came to what they called moderate workflow, which means a cease fire</p>
<p class="body">They declared a cease fire with the government based upon theological revisions</p>
<p class="body">And as a reward for their revisions of their of their violence, they were put into this prison, where their political wing were, rather than the violent wing, right? </p>
<p class="body">And so, because we were the political wing, they were then deemed as being safe to be put with</p>
<p class="body">The political side of it, as opposed to the terrorist side</p>
<p class="body">So then I got to mix with these guys and I spent</p>
<p class="body">All that time, reading their revisions in Arabic, debating it with them</p>
<p class="body">Speaking to the other prisoners like there was this liberal presidential candidate called a man or who was thrown in jail because he was a presidential candidate</p>
<p class="body">He stood for election against Mubarak, threw him in jail</p>
<p class="body">They used some corruption charges on him, but everyone knew that he was because he stood as president and he wasn't an endorsed candidate</p>
<p class="body">He was in jail, so I spoke to people that had a liberal ideology</p>
<p class="body">Revised Islamist ideology</p>
<p class="body">Communist prisoners spoke to everybody and then did a lot of my own reading, and one of the interesting things for me was reading in particular</p>
<p class="body">English literature read a lot of talking</p>
<p class="body">A lot of oil</p>
<p class="body">I even read the Harry Potter books</p>
<p class="body">In a jihadi jail wow and the interesting thing we're talking Orwell in particular is there's a lot you can learn from those stories that relate to our situation today</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There's a lot of heroes journey stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Precisely, yeah so</p>
<p class="body">And then</p>
<p class="body">On top of that I read a</p>
<p class="body">Lot of Islamic theology, a lot of out</p>
<p class="body">I continued with my Arabic studies and the more I learn, the more I studied, the more tolerant I became and the more the dogma that I had adopted began to unravel</p>
<p class="body">And this is</p>
<p class="body">You know of my dialogue with Sam</p>
<p class="body">It became an Amazon film</p>
<p class="body">It's explained in that a lot of it is in the book with that that I did with Sam published by Harvard, which was my second book</p>
<p class="body">But in essence, the more I learned about my tradition and MyHeritage, I was ignorant of that because I wasn't born with that heritage. I was born in, you know, in dislocation from it</p>
<p class="body">But sitting with those who had studied this and those who had spent many years thinking about this, the more I learned, the more open I became</p>
<p class="body">And because Amnesty had initially opened my heart</p>
<p class="body">I began looking for alternatives</p>
<p class="body">Now what I didn't want to do was leave the group or even announce leaving the group while in jail</p>
<p class="body">I have a bit more dignity than that</p>
<p class="body">I didn't want anyone to think I've done it because I'm in prison and someone pressured me, so I left prison</p>
<p class="body">Still a committed member of the group on paper</p>
<p class="body">Got back to the UK and even did some interviews as a member of the group, but within that year</p>
<p class="body">It became very apparent to me that I was living a contradiction and I could no longer maintain in that further the sort of the dogma that I that I adopted I had had to UN</p>
<p class="body">You know, I'd unpicked it in my mind in such a way that it was no longer sustainable for me to to to remain on the leadership, and then the group I was with</p>
<p class="body">Offered me directly to become the leader in the UK</p>
<p class="body">So within that week I had a choice to make</p>
<p class="body">Either I live a lie</p>
<p class="body">And I lead this organization while no longer believing</p>
<p class="body">That this is good for anyone's future</p>
<p class="body">Or I resign so I unilaterally and openly announced my resignation from the group and also my abandonment of my previous ideology in the favor of a more</p>
<p class="body">And organic understanding of my heritage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, how was that met within the group? </p>
<p class="body">How kind of outrage? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, my marriage fell apart</p>
<p class="body">My entire identity up until that point had been defined by families and friends around this ideology and organization</p>
<p class="body">All of that imagine you've been plucked out of your reality and you have to reconstruct yourself from nothing</p>
<p class="body">But on top of that, you've just come out of jail</p>
<p class="body">The War on Terror is at its peak, Tony Blair is Prime Minister and Bush</p>
<p class="body">Junior is president, so the world hates you</p>
<p class="body">Because everyone thinks you're the enemy, you've just lost all your friends and you have to build yourself back up again from nothing with nothing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How did you maintain your resolve during that period? </p>
'cause I've gotta imagine the pull to go back to your old ways</p>
<p class="body">It's probably very strong because there's community there, and even though you had come to this realization in jail and through all your reading that there had to been</p>
<p class="body">A great pull</p>
<p class="body">To try to bring you back to the old life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">This is why today we're talking about contemporary debates</p>
<p class="body">The the stance I've taken against tyranny and I won't mince my words on it</p>
<p class="body">This is why it's so insulting</p>
<p class="body">It's seriously ignorant where some voices have come out and said our imagine now has become radical</p>
<p class="body">He's radicalized</p>
<p class="body">Sorry, I'll use the word radical myself, radicalized</p>
<p class="body">He's become an extremist again</p>
<p class="body">These people have absolutely no idea what extremism is</p>
<p class="body">They have no idea what it takes to inoculate yourself against that before anyone else was even talking about counter extremism</p>
<p class="body">They have no idea the inner discipline it takes to pull yourself out of that and lose everything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, where's that line? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean it was</p>
<p class="body">It was incredibly difficult</p>
<p class="body">But what gets what got me through it and what gets me through it today to to to draw that similar analogy? </p>
<p class="body">What got me through it then? </p>
<p class="body">Is you have to have a belief in why you're doing what you're doing</p>
<p class="body">And I</p>
<p class="body">I went seeking and I found people who were far better than the people I was following</p>
<p class="body">Who were also consistent to my heritage</p>
<p class="body">And yet believed in</p>
<p class="body">Finding what we have in common and bringing people together rather than dividing people, there are again back to teachers</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, spiritual guides</p>
<p class="body">One of the first things that I needed to land on some form of spiritual and humanitarian platform</p>
<p class="body">So I went to Sufi shaikhs who practice to solar for or purification of the soul of the inside to try and make sure that you're on a firm foundation and I went looking</p>
<p class="body">And I got very lucky that one spiritual</p>
<p class="body">Who I spoke to early on and he said, listen, you're gonna go on a journey</p>
<p class="body">Trust the journey</p>
<p class="body">And the important thing is we stay in touch but trust the journey and as long as your intention is good, you will land on your feet</p>
<p class="body">And I remember one of the things he said to me, he said</p>
<p class="body">We're in this situation now where it's almost like this Muslim Western divide</p>
<p class="body">As I say, the War on Terror was ongoing</p>
<p class="body">Blair was Prime Minister, Bush was president</p>
<p class="body">And he said to me</p>
<p class="body">Just imagine you're like</p>
<p class="body">Moses in the court pharaoh and you're there and you're going to speak to these people to try and make them understand what you've understood as to why you pulled back from that brink</p>
<p class="body">To try and help them understand that war isn't the way forward</p>
<p class="body">With this, the whole War on Terror discourse, the whole paradigm</p>
<p class="body">So I spent the next 10 years of my life on that guidance given to me by Sheikh Ali</p>
<p class="body">Attempting to from the inside, working with the machine I'm now going to call it the machine, right? </p>
<p class="body">The system</p>
<p class="body">Working with that machine</p>
<p class="body">In an attempt to be like Moses in the court of Pharaoh</p>
<p class="body">Let them see through my example</p>
<p class="body">What can be rather than what? </p>
<p class="body">The bad things that you think are</p>
<p class="body">The good that can be right? </p>
<p class="body">So I met with Blair</p>
<p class="body">I met with Bush in his house in Texas</p>
<p class="body">I met Blair a few times I've met with PM Cameron</p>
<p class="body">Met with Trudeau</p>
<p class="body">I've met with a lot of these people in an attempt to show them there's another way</p>
<p class="body">What I realized over the course of that attempt and we can get into some of this detail</p>
<p class="body">But what brings me here today is 10 years of being an Islamist revolutionary</p>
<p class="body">And then ten years</p>
<p class="body">Of attempting to work on</p>
<p class="body">On that high level, in governments in that machine, to try and soften the power of that machine, soften its own self inflicted blows such as the invasion of Iraq</p>
<p class="body">Such as, you know, arbitrary kill lists</p>
<p class="body">Assassinating people without due process to try and end that war, and instead bring about a dialogue</p>
<p class="body">Unfortunately, the machine I was trying to work with I don't believe it's any longer possible to work on the inside and achieve</p>
<p class="body">That aim how so? </p>
<p class="body">Mission creep</p>
<p class="body">Mission creep, yeah</p>
<p class="body">So I so you may know, but for your listeners I'll say that after leaving that organization I set up a group called Quilliam in an attempt to be that you know what? </p>
<p class="body">The guidance that was given to me and and I don't think I'd be where I am without that guidance you ask about how I did it</p>
<p class="body">You have to have strong people around you</p>
<p class="body">And you have to have an understanding of who you are and not lose that</p>
<p class="body">And it's very difficult</p>
<p class="body">But ten years I'm trying to work with that machine to say, look</p>
<p class="body">Yes, there's a I can help you on the ideological side of how to how to speak to those Muslims who have gone down that path</p>
<p class="body">But on your side, there is some responsibility</p>
<p class="body">You've got to respect the civil liberties values that you claim you're fighting for</p>
<p class="body">So if you're saying they hate our democracy, they hate our freedoms</p>
<p class="body">That's not going to wash if you're invading countries</p>
<p class="body">If you say they hate our democracies, they hate our freedoms</p>
<p class="body">That's not going to wash if you're torturing people or you're outsourcing your torture</p>
<p class="body">Two dictators that you support financially now this is true</p>
<p class="body">With the UK as well as the US, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's now established, not it's not what I'm saying now, isn't any longer in dispute, but it used to be when I first started talking about it</p>
<p class="body">There's a guy called Abdul Hakim Belhaj from Libya</p>
<p class="body">Who it's now being established that the British authorities outsourced his torture? </p>
<p class="body">And that's now not even in dispute anymore</p>
<p class="body">And they relied on the intelligence that they knew they got through him being tortured in a third country</p>
<p class="body">It's called extraordinary rendition</p>
<p class="body">When Western countries outsource torture to dictators and then rely on that intelligence to make their next move and my point is if you're fighting for your values</p>
<p class="body">Right, Joe? </p>
<p class="body">If you're if you're reacting because you're a father and you want to defend your children, the last thing you're going to do that is consistent with that is harm</p>
<p class="body">Other peoples children</p>
<p class="body">If you're fighting to defend children, so you're saying to me you're you're fighting for your values, but then don't outsource torture, don't invade countries, don't arbitrarily kill people from the skies without due process like a 17 year old American</p>
<p class="body">And we're all lucky, son who was bombed under Obama's presidency in Yemen because they wanted their father. They knew the 17 year old was there next to him and they decided to bomb anyway</p>
<p class="body">And The thing is, if you start behaving like this, of course every action causes a reaction, and there's me in the middle trying trying to say these guys are wrong</p>
<p class="body">But this is also wrong</p>
<p class="body">Yes, now that machine</p>
<p class="body">It took me a while, ten years of attempting to try and you know, rein in the excess on both sides, of course, doesn't earn you any friends</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I ask you more about the process like how do you go about meeting these people? </p>
<p class="body">Like how does this setup like how do you meet Trudeau? </p>
<p class="body">How you meeting Bush? </p>
<p class="body">How is this? </p>
<p class="body">How is this facilitated? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">At the time I was the only one publicly speaking about any of this, and so they were all desperate to hear</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">From me because you or someone who was radicalized at one point in time and had converted over and they trusted</p>
<p class="body">You or is it? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Every single one of these was an invitation</p>
<p class="body">I didn't ask for any</p>
<p class="body">Of these business</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And how did they know of you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's interesting because we forget what the media world used to look like</p>
<p class="body">With the Internet today I did all the kind of you know the prime time, so I did in the UK</p>
<p class="body">BBC Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman here</p>
<p class="body">I did CBS</p>
60 minutes</p>
<p class="body">Larry King, So what used to be the prime time shows they're not any yeah, right? </p>
<p class="body">But so people would would would see this guy on their on their, you know on the CBS 60 minutes like who the hell is this guy who's just like he's been in jail? </p>
<p class="body">He's now speaking against this stuff</p>
<p class="body">So I would be invited</p>
<p class="body">I was invited to Bush's home</p>
<p class="body">In fact</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What was that like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I'll tell you a story because he sat me down and like you you did, he said, well, tell me about yourself and I got to the point of when I said oh they tortured us in prison</p>
<p class="body">And he said, I opened my book with his story, by the way, he said, stop right there</p>
<p class="body">I said alright, OK? </p>
<p class="body">And if you remember, Bush was that whole waterboarding and redefining torture, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so he says stop right there</p>
<p class="body">So I stopped</p>
<p class="body">He looked at me in the eyes, he said, how do you define torture? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What was your impression of him as a person? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">When I looked him back square in the eyes, I said, you know, electrocution on the teeth and genitalia</p>
<p class="body">And he said, yeah, that's torture</p>
<p class="body">Carry on</p>
<p class="body">Now the interesting thing with Bush is very well I found him to be very personable</p>
<p class="body">But then you know that really doesn't mean much when you're in in charge of a country that invades another country, but one on one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He was very easy to talk to</p>
<p class="body">Did he seem slow? </p>
<p class="body">No, not at all, right? </p>
<p class="body">Was that an act? </p>
<p class="body">Do you? </p>
<p class="body">Think that kind of down home all Shucks type</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">What I've learned is look at media narratives today</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and it's so often the impression we have in media</p>
<p class="body">Is a narrative built up, and especially in those days before we had decentralized media</p>
<p class="body">It was a monopoly on how you define somebody, and so whatever the media defined Bush as actually one on one in person speaking to him, he wasn't that at all</p>
<p class="body">And so it must have just been a narrative built up around him</p>
<p class="body">He was very personable, very easy to talk to, very alert in conversation, more so than most world leaders that I've spoken to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Isn't it fascinating that today he is thought of as a reasonable Republican and he's thought of as like boy? </p>
<p class="body">If only George W Bush was running for president like we think about him, the standards of behavior</p>
<p class="body">If everything is shifted and and Trump threw a monkey wrench into the gears</p>
<p class="body">That ******** the machine so hard? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that they look back with with nostalgia of the days of Bush, but I can remember when Bush was president</p>
<p class="body">The hate that people had for him</p>
<p class="body">It was like it was palpable and then</p>
<p class="body">When we invaded Iraq then it changed because after 911 then he had given this big speech and he had, you know he stepped up in this way where we felt comfortable like fine we have a leader</p>
<p class="body">We've been attacked</p>
<p class="body">We have to unite as a nation</p>
<p class="body">This is a real leader and he gave a real speech and even Democrats were saying</p>
<p class="body">Yes, we have a real president</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">One thing that's interesting about those years is before the invasion of Iraq, Muslim Americans used to generally vote Republican</p>
<p class="body">And the reason was largely, again, there's always exceptions</p>
<p class="body">The reason was largely because of the social conservative family values</p>
<p class="body">Muslims are very socially conservative, believe in family, believe in community</p>
<p class="body">Uh, all all</p>
<p class="body">The all the debates you hear today about liberals and the whole kind of, you know, LGBT and all that stuff you can imagine coming from a religious background</p>
<p class="body">Muslims are a lot more conservative on that stuff</p>
<p class="body">They used to vote for Republican Party and then Iraq happened and they switched to the Democrats</p>
<p class="body">And I think we're in a moment now where that switch is going back from the Democrats back very slowly back to the Republicans again</p>
<p class="body">And Trump's last election result demonstrated that trend because despite Trump's presidency and I often get accused of all sorts of things. Look, I have been on the streets in London protesting President Trump when he floated the Muslim ban because I'm married to a beautiful American woman</p>
<p class="body">And I would</p>
<p class="body">I was worried about being banned coming into America with my background</p>
<p class="body">It actually meant something, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so I was on the streets protesting Trump, so despite me you know what I'm about to say? </p>
<p class="body">I don't want anyone to misinterpret</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly our measures Trump supporters</p>
<p class="body">I'm tired of people putting words in my mouth</p>
<p class="body">They haven't lived my life</p>
<p class="body">They don't know why</p>
<p class="body">I think what I think</p>
<p class="body">But having protested Trump</p>
<p class="body">It is interesting to see the results that he got in these elections</p>
<p class="body">His share of the Muslim vote went up and his share of the African American vote went up, knocked down</p>
<p class="body">This last 2020 election</p>
<p class="body">And I I think that's the beginning of something that's happening</p>
<p class="body">Where people on the social stuff, these communities and the same for Latino votes</p>
<p class="body">By the way, these communities I think they're beginning to prioritize their social conservative once more</p>
<p class="body">Because when you looked at foreign policy, there's not really too much that Biden redeems himself on</p>
<p class="body">So I think that that vote is going to switch back again, but yeah</p>
<p class="body">These these guys</p>
<p class="body">I attempted for about 10 years through my then organization Quilliam</p>
<p class="body">To attempt to pretty much has happened to me on the Islamist side, to attempt to try and soften some of that</p>
<p class="body">Hard edge of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">War and how was that met with Bush? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">He was charming, but of course it wasn't ever going to</p>
<p class="body">Be Bush, it was going to be</p>
<p class="body">The people around</p>
<p class="body">Him right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What was Dave on what you were saying? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Mind that his perspective, well, the last two years of the Bush Presidency</p>
<p class="body">I think they really began getting to grips with some of this</p>
<p class="body">And again, that's not a popular thing to say, and I remember the time is that those last year they began realizing that that this has to be more of an ideological and intellectual conversation, and not a physical war</p>
<p class="body">You can't win right right in this war and said there was no way anyone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Was going to win until they were stuck in this situation, whereas</p>
<p class="body">Many years deep into the war and realizing that they had done everything that they were trying to avoid, we had had that one desert storm war and I think people had come under the impression that if we were to invade a country, it would be very quick and very easy</p>
<p class="body">We had this very American centric idea of what would go on in the war</p>
<p class="body">Because of that, it made us so much more willing to enter into wars</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's insane, it's insane if a foreign army occupied America, would you just sit back and let them stay here for 10? </p>
<p class="body">I mean come on, no man worth his salt is gonna sit there and watch our foreign army in there</p>
<p class="body">If anyone invaded Britain, I'd be the first to say sign me up</p>
<p class="body">Where do I join? </p>
<p class="body">No one is just going to let foreign troops in their land, right? </p>
<p class="body">So but this madness was brought about because back in those days</p>
<p class="body">Bush didn't even know the difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That it was just pure ignorance that that the foreign policy neoconservative machine was hoodwinked by this guy, called chalaby in Iraq, who convinced them that if you invade, everything is gonna be hunky Dory</p>
<p class="body">Iraq is going to blossom into this democracy. All that end up happening is 60% of Iraq was Shia. You end up creating this satellite of sphere of influence for Iran</p>
<p class="body">Because Iran is is Shia origin country and ended up having this disproportionate influence in Iraq as a result</p>
<p class="body">And you end up with a situation today, I mean</p>
<p class="body">It's a mess when</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You think back to this man trying to convince the Bush administration that everything was going to be fine? </p>
<p class="body">It was going to blossoming and with democracy</p>
<p class="body">What do you think was his motivation? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think ultimately he knew that the Shia and the Sunni would go to battle and there would be a massive conflict? </p>
<p class="body">And that it would destabilize the region</p>
<p class="body">Do you think he was aware of that? </p>
<p class="body">Or do you think they were operating on ignorance? </p>
<p class="body">Or do you think they were operating under this premise that they were going to get to control the natural resources and it was worth it financially and they would sort it all out? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, you know</p>
<p class="body">Individual intentions aside, if you look to Cheney, if you look to Rumsfeld and if you looked at this guy chalaby, he was from the Iraqi National Congress</p>
<p class="body">And if you look at everything that happened since then and the behavior in Iraq and and beyond</p>
<p class="body">It's definitely not</p>
<p class="body">About bringing democracy</p>
<p class="body">Now the jury is out for me</p>
<p class="body">Is it oil? </p>
<p class="body">Is it natural resources? </p>
<p class="body">Is it strategic positioning? </p>
<p class="body">It's definitely not what the reason that we were told, and it certainly wasn't weapons of mass destruction that was all built on a lie, and that's also come out since</p>
<p class="body">The dossier 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you think they knew about the lie for sure? </p>
<p class="body">How many people do you think knew about like when they were broadcasting on CNN weapons of mass destruction, we have to invade Iraq</p>
<p class="body">Who do you think knew that that was not true? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean so, remember Colin Powell, I'm quite sure he knew he was speaking ******** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">God, that's so hard to believe? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's so hard because he's he was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">A good man, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And you know when you when you hunt</p>
<p class="body">Having an example of a man who is a distinguished military career and then goes on to be a distinguished politician</p>
<p class="body">He's one of the best examples we've ever had</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But you remember he was opposed to it for a long time, yes</p>
<p class="body">And then he gave that one speech</p>
<p class="body">I think it was at the UN</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and I think that's the point that he</p>
<p class="body">He knew what was going</p>
<p class="body">He was opposed to it, he didn't wanna follow this</p>
<p class="body">He had a vial or something and then somebody gave him something and then he said, alright</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, and and I think when he did that that speech</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I think he knew in his heart something</p>
<p class="body">Is not right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What was the vile what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Did he have? </p>
<p class="body">I can't remember, but it was used as evidence, right? </p>
<p class="body">What we've had since in the UK as an inquiry, and they found that Tony Blair, pretty much you know, they all knew that something wasn't right with this intelligence</p>
<p class="body">They were given and this 15 minutes thing, it just wasn't right</p>
<p class="body">You know, and the guy the guy that exposed it</p>
<p class="body">One of our scientists in the UK that Saddam can can strike within 15 minutes of it, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
15 minutes thanks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And there's a guy who, in particular with the weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p class="body">Now again caveat, Saddam is no picnic, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, for sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean the man was gassed his own people</p>
<p class="body">He he was</p>
<p class="body">He's the Iraqi equivalent of Mubarak</p>
<p class="body">That did what he did to us in Egypt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And his sons were the most evil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, again, people think I'm going to defend</p>
<p class="body">This isn't about defending</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, it's just true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Sedans is</p>
<p class="body">The first, the first death in our organization, my former group was in Iraq</p>
<p class="body">One of our members was tortured to death by Saddam</p>
<p class="body">We were attempting to overthrow Saddam too, right? </p>
<p class="body">So this is no favoritism to Saddam Hussein coming from me</p>
<p class="body">What I'm saying is that you don't go in</p>
<p class="body">Into war based on a lie and this guy called Doctor Kelly in the UK</p>
<p class="body">He was the scientist from our whatever our defence sector who exposed this lie</p>
<p class="body">He turned up dead a couple weeks later</p>
<p class="body">No one knows what happened to him</p>
<p class="body">He's dead, so it's just all weird, right? </p>
<p class="body">But looking back? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Died of what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">They found him dead in his car</p>
<p class="body">I think it's officially was suicide, whatever, who knows? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean I don't know</p>
<p class="body">Was Epstein suicide? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I say no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean it doesn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What do you say? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Look like it does it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I get very uncomfortable when people say he did commit suicide</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a bit</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Weird, isn't it? </p>
<p class="body">Or I started asking them questions like why do you think that like did you look at the autopsy? </p>
<p class="body">Did you ever hear Michael Baden speak about it? </p>
<p class="body">Where he? </p>
<p class="body">Talks about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, cameras were switched off</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Ligature marks at the bottom of his neck, which indicate he was strangled</p>
<p class="body">Do you? </p>
<p class="body">Did you hear about the broke break in broken bones rather? </p>
<p class="body">In his neck? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like that don't exist</p>
<p class="body">Normally when people hang themselves they usually are only from someone being strangled</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's a desire the camera thing</p>
<p class="body">The security guards conveniently sleeping like there's so much</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's all strange</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's in front of everybody's face watching pillar rabbit out of my hat</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and you're like holy **** if the light</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Lie is big enough, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is a good one, though</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean it's</p>
<p class="body">It's quite extraordinary that they would pull that off</p>
<p class="body">They were able to pull that off in front</p>
<p class="body">Of everyone's eyes, well, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't if they pulled it off I</p>
<p class="body">I'm not so sure</p>
<p class="body">People deep down really, really, truly believe that that's that</p>
<p class="body">I mean everyone I think realizes more than meets the</p>
<p class="body">Eye with that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I think so too</p>
<p class="body">To speak about it, but it's gone on long enough that I think it's going to be a part of the past</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and people are just gonna go what happened to him, who knows</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, what happened to? </p>
<p class="body">Kennedy, who knows like I just said</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">With doctor Kenny</p>
<p class="body">Right, who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, who knows</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But what we have learned from that is</p>
<p class="body">Easy to manufacture</p>
<p class="body">Uh, my consent around something that isn't true for foreign policy purposes</p>
<p class="body">It was done with Iraq and my whole thing was</p>
<p class="body">How do we stop that happening again, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's what I</p>
<p class="body">Was trying to do with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">With Bush with all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, when but</p>
<p class="body">When you went through</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">To Cameron what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What kind of dialogue did you have with Bush in terms of like trying to convince him to take a different approach? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, so as I say in these last two years they were listening</p>
<p class="body">So I met with Secretary Chertoff who founded the Homeland Security</p>
<p class="body">He used to be a judge</p>
<p class="body">We would work very closely with Homeland Security</p>
<p class="body">And that entire group</p>
<p class="body">And what happened was if you recall, so those last two years, then Obama got elected</p>
<p class="body">And as always, just as we felt, we will make beginning to make progress</p>
<p class="body">I mean, one of my long</p>
<p class="body">My bugbears has long been we have to Shuck wantanabe down this idea that that we can</p>
<p class="body">Throw people in jail for years and years and years over decades with no charge, right? </p>
<p class="body">It started with jihadi prisoners</p>
<p class="body">You're going to Syria</p>
<p class="body">It moved from jihadi prisoners to their wives and their children now, so there's just been a jailbreak in Syria and ISIS attempted jailbreak</p>
<p class="body">Now there's a bit</p>
<p class="body">There's a bit of detail to that story there that's more interesting than the fact that ISIS in the first organized attack</p>
<p class="body">For many years since the fall of their so-called Islamic State</p>
<p class="body">Have demonstrated that they've regrouped because they had a full frontal assault on this jail</p>
<p class="body">But that's not what interests me and I think that the Kurdish forces have retaken it just yesterday</p>
<p class="body">What interests me is the detail in this in this little story</p>
<p class="body">And that is that</p>
<p class="body">It turns out that there were hundreds of children in this jail</p>
<p class="body">Children born to ISIS fighters who nobody wanted to take care of, so they threw them in this adult jihadi prison</p>
<p class="body">Hundreds of children, some of whom died in this attempted jailbreak</p>
<p class="body">So we've gone from and this is where when the Overton window shifts in that way, when you say our bushes years, if only our value system has shifted so much to a point, we are now</p>
<p class="body">Living with this idea that our</p>
<p class="body">States and our allies can throw children in jail for years with some of the most dangerous people on the planet</p>
<p class="body">And it went from jihadis in Guantanamo to, in Syria now, to their wives and children, including by the way Western citizens</p>
<p class="body">So this jailbreak some of the kids that were killed, 16 year old, 17 year olds</p>
<p class="body">Western Citizens, Australians, you know and others</p>
<p class="body">American is an American kid in the Times newspaper</p>
<p class="body">It was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And why were they in? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The prison, because they were taken there as kids by their jihadi parents and nobody wants to do</p>
<p class="body">No Western government credit to America under Trump</p>
<p class="body">You guys took back all your foreign foreign fighters from ISIS</p>
<p class="body">Britain hasn't done so, nor have most European</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Took back all our foreign fighters</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Who were Americans who went to join ISIS? </p>
<p class="body">They're now back in the yeah, they're they're back and you know you bring them back</p>

<p class="body">We don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And if there's a crime to answer for, you put them on trial</p>
<p class="body">But what you haven't done, what America hasn't done is say, you know what? </p>
<p class="body">I don't give a damn</p>
<p class="body">They might be American, but they can stay in Syria</p>
<p class="body">And even if they're sentenced in Syria, say they finish their time, where do they go? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So that's what's happened is nobody saw this camps</p>
<p class="body">There are entire camps, they're just internship camps, concentration camps, or intern camps like Al Hawl kamphol in Syria, where there's women and children</p>
<p class="body">Kids from babies and they're growing up and they're having they're giving birth</p>
<p class="body">In these prisons, and they're just no one charge them or convicted them</p>
<p class="body">Of anything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So they're essentially being raised in these prisons</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">They are born and raised in prisons, Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="body">Now you go from Guantanamo to that and I'm gonna bring you to another stage, right? </p>
<p class="body">We talk about the Overton window of acceptability shifting</p>
<p class="body">We've got a home secretary in the UK right now called Priti Patel</p>
<p class="body">She then suggested that what do you do with these boat people that come over from France and they're trying to cross the English Channel undocumented migrants? </p>
<p class="body">They're landing in Britain</p>
<p class="body">What do you do with them, she said</p>
<p class="body">Oh, I know what we can do with them</p>
<p class="body">Arrest them</p>
<p class="body">And then put them in a camp in Rwanda</p>
<p class="body">So you've gone from we've gone from arbitrarily interning jihadis to arbitrarily interning their wives and their children to now arbitrarily interning</p>
<p class="body">Anyone who's undocumented in these camps? </p>
<p class="body">That's not the kind of world I want to see going forward</p>
<p class="body">It's it's like that movie at Liceum, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, that's not the kind of world I want to see going forward, so this is the kind of</p>
<p class="body">Thing that I was upset with in that machine and I'm trying to work in the machine to say what you guys are doing is making the problem worse with this kind of behavior</p>
<p class="body">Power brute force does not fix your problems</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And these conversations, with Bush in particular, like what was that, like? </p>
<p class="body">How did he respond to this? </p>
<p class="body">So so? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So Bush was one meeting and after that one meeting I was able to speak to the administration</p>
<p class="body">And as I say, so for the last two years, I felt we felt we were beginning to make progress</p>
<p class="body">Obama gets in</p>
<p class="body">And then they want to reinvent the wheel and a lot of people when they look at Obama</p>
<p class="body">They think a great president again</p>
<p class="body">I'm not gonna mince my words and I don't want anyone to say oh see Majid is this or that guys I'm</p>
<p class="body">Learning jihadis to arbitrarily interning their wives and their children to now, arbitrarily interning</p>
<p class="body">Anyone who's undocumented in these camps</p>
<p class="body">That's not the kind of world I want to see going forward</p>
<p class="body">It's it's like that movie Elysium, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's not the kind of world I want to see going forward</p>
<p class="body">So this is the kind of thing that I was upset with in that machine and I'm trying to work in the machine to say</p>
<p class="body">What you guys are doing is making the problem worse with this kind of behavior</p>
<p class="body">Power brute force does not fix your problems</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And these conversations, with Bush in particular, like what was that, like? </p>
<p class="body">How did he respond to this? </p>
<p class="body">So so? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Bush was one meeting and after that one meeting I was able to speak to the administration</p>
<p class="body">And as I say, so for the last two years I felt we felt we were beginning to make progress</p>
<p class="body">Obama gets in</p>
<p class="body">And then they want to reinvent the wheel and a lot of people when they look at Obama</p>
<p class="body">They think a great president again</p>
<p class="body">I'm not gonna mince my words and I don't want anyone to say oh see Majid is this or that guys I'm you don't understand</p>
<p class="body">I didn't even come from this system</p>
<p class="body">I wanted to overthrow the</p>
<p class="body">Whole thing Obama and Bush together</p>
<p class="body">I was anti democracy full stop</p>
<p class="body">So this is not about me supporting Bush supporting Obama supporting Trump</p>
<p class="body">Supposing anyone, I'm looking at this from the outside and seeing what's going wrong</p>
<p class="body">Visa V</p>
<p class="body">This specific debate, you know? </p>
<p class="body">And speaking objectively about it, regardless of whether you're left wing or right wing, so Obama comes in</p>
<p class="body">And this man launches more drone strikes than Bush has a kill list which Bush never had</p>
<p class="body">That is unaccountable</p>
<p class="body">That kill list he made, including American citizens, was not accountable to Congress</p>
<p class="body">So on the on, the physical war side, he basically did even more than Bush did</p>
<p class="body">With his assassinations with his NSA spying 
<p class="body">With his 
<p class="body">Military approach to solving problems with his drones</p>
<p class="body">More drone strikes than Bush ever conducted</p>
<p class="body">He just ratcheted up the military side of this</p>
<p class="body">And we were then when Obama became president, my work was for a long time ostracized from the Obama administration because of this point</p>
<p class="body">And then where he should have done something like the rise of ISIS completely? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Useless so you that your work was ostracized because you were working towards peace and a less brutal approach and he was conducting drone strikes and NSA surveillance</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">They didn't wanna hear what I just said to you</p>
<p class="body">Yeah they don't wanna hear it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They just didn't want to hear that and they, but they knew your position and did you eventually get to meet with him? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Not him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Wow, I met</p>
<p class="body">I met</p>
<p class="body">I met Hillary Clinton</p>
<p class="body">I met Madeline Albright but I didn't meet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Obama, did you ever meet anybody they smell like sulfur? </p>
<p class="body">What any of those people we like? </p>
<p class="body">They're evil</p>
<p class="body">This is an evil person</p>
<p class="body">This is for sure</p>
<p class="body">From straight from hell</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So anyway, just ******* around</p>
<p class="body">I wouldn't</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, not as good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But you met Hillary Clinton</p>
<p class="body">You met George Bush</p>
<p class="body">Who else did you meet inside the organization? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">On the US side</p>
<p class="body">Madeleine Albright secretary Chertoff when he was head of the Homeland Security Department</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Was any one group or one administration more open to your ideas? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the same thing happened</p>
<p class="body">It's usually the case, right? </p>
<p class="body">It takes six years last two years of the Obama administration, like the last two years of Bush, they began listening</p>
<p class="body">To us 
<p class="body">And then of course Biden, sorry, Trump comes in</p>
<p class="body">The interesting thing is again that whole ISIS problem was playing out under Biden under Obama</p>
<p class="body">Sorry yeah</p>
<p class="body">But what what I began witnessing is I'm going to call that machine</p>
<p class="body">I'm gonna call it mission creep</p>
<p class="body">You've got to a situation now under Biden</p>
<p class="body">Where even those that</p>
<p class="body">Who are Trump supporters who question the US election and it's you know</p>
<p class="body">You know transparency are now being defined as domestic extremists or domestic terrorists, and this is where I have to exit because I'm I'm saying, OK, hold on</p>
<p class="body">You guys, first of all, you have no idea what extremism is</p>
<p class="body">No idea what terrorism is and if you're going to weaponize that language and start applying it onto people that question and election right? </p>
<p class="body">I cannot be a part of that, so I shot Quilliam down</p>
<p class="body">Unilaterally just shut the thing down</p>
<p class="body">I will not be used to stigmatize Trump voters as domestic extremists extremism</p>
<p class="body">Terrorism is a very specific thing, and you're going to</p>
<p class="body">It's like racism, you disagreeing with me isn't racist, right? </p>
<p class="body">But that's how it's being used often right these days, right? </p>
<p class="body">And you're going to use that people like me</p>
<p class="body">That's actually dodge, hammer attacks, machete attacks</p>
<p class="body">Screwdriver attacks watch friends get stabbed over that thing called racism</p>
<p class="body">I will stop you misusing that word because I know that if the boy cries wolf</p>
<p class="body">Then when some little kid like me is trying to run away from the real race</p>
<p class="body">It's not going to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Believe them</p>
<p class="body">Would you categorize people like the January 6th attack at at the very least? </p>
<p class="body">There's some amongst them that are extremists</p>
<p class="body">There was people that showed up at the Capitol with zip ties</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean, and they were looking for politicians</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there are some amongst them that most certainly were extremists</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Absolutely, that's like there's some among Muslims that were extremists</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but</p>
<p class="body">But the language is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">See the concern though from the administration that there, at the very least, there's the beginnings of something that could be absolutely awful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and that's where you've got to be accurate in</p>
<p class="body">Your language</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But there I think that's the problem, right? </p>
<p class="body">That they they use hyperbole</p>
<p class="body">They use exaggeration and also they use agent provocateurs</p>
<p class="body">Precisely that conversation where Ted Cruz was speaking to the woman from the FBI</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure you've seen that where she said, have you ever incited? </p>
<p class="body">Has the agency incited violence? </p>
<p class="body">I can't answer that</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, when when she rattles off a bunch of things that she can't answer you like hey, there's supposed to be a real ******* clear answer to all those questions</p>
<p class="body">It's supposed to be no, no, we don't do any of that stuff 'cause that stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
's illegal entrapment</p>
<p class="body">Entrapment is not legal in</p>
<p class="body">The UK, but it still is here</p>
<p class="body">And it gets used often and you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It gets used often</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Know we we? </p>
<p class="body">You know we know</p>
<p class="body">There were certain people in that crowd that were with law enforcement, yes, and they were behaving less than admirably</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And with yeah</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and it seems like there was some people that had a vested interest in this going sideways, and I think it was a tool to sort of label the administration as being</p>
<p class="body">Even more awful than they already</p>
<p class="body">Thought it was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, but you know it's like it's like</p>
<p class="body">You're not vaccinated, right? </p>
<p class="body">No right doesn't</p>
<p class="body">So I stop using labels, anti vaccine, right just to try and to to pigeonhole you before you even speak, right? </p>
<p class="body">So we've got to be careful with language because it's</p>
<p class="body">A weapon, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The anti VAX thing is a big language</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, so it's the same with the US elections and it's the same with Muslims and terrorism. And I began realizing that this language was being weaponized for the purposes, not of achieving a solution to the problem</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">We're attempting to fix, but for politics and I thought you know what the problem here is</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to be instrumentalize my language</p>
<p class="body">My work is going to be instrumentalized</p>
<p class="body">And so I had to get out and do what I'm doing from the outside in these sorts of conversations instead</p>
<p class="body">There's no way I could remain part of that phenomenon</p>
<p class="body">I mean, look Joe, you asked me about who won Bush V Gore in Florida</p>
<p class="body">Till this day I'll say to you, I think Gore won</p>
<p class="body">Does that make me an extremist? </p>
<p class="body">Now obviously Bush became president</p>
<p class="body">Obviously I have to deal with that reality and</p>
<p class="body">Accept it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but if you ask me what's my opinion. Bush's brother was governor</p>
<p class="body">There's something going on with the chads or</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Whatever you call them, wasn't there something going on with John Kerry too? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, something weird right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That election too, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Now I've got a right</p>
<p class="body">I've got a right</p>
<p class="body">To question yeah Bush V Gore</p>
<p class="body">Just as a Trump voter has a right to question Biden V</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, I, I think you do have a right and I also think there's an issue where it's fun</p>
<p class="body">To think in elections rigged? </p>
<p class="body">There's a, there's an excite</p>
<p class="body">I don't want funds of bad word there's an excitement that attaches to it that's akin</p>
<p class="body">To conspiracy theories</p>
<p class="body">It's akin to people that go looking for</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">UFO's yeah yeah but I wouldn't go so far as they rigged my. My questions were more you know the Time magazine. Yeah they do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, but some people do think it's rigged and that's what's exciting to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Them yeah Umm</p>
<p class="body">The Time magazine</p>
<p class="body">Piece, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Which piece the the piece that explained the the wording it used was like there's a cabal of well organized financed people that saved democracy on that day</p>
<p class="body">Of the election</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Though that's right, yeah, that's right</p>
<p class="body">That's what I'm talking about that that leads to question Mark, right? </p>

<p class="body">That's right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's sneaky talk</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And they use the word cabal, right? </p>
<p class="body">So as somebody who was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We fortified the election right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">At the school</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's the word they use, fortified, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So as somebody who at the time was a broadcaster on a talk show on mainstream UK radio</p>
<p class="body">It's my job to say what the heck? </p>
<p class="body">Is this yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Right, So what? </p>
<p class="body">I didn't want to be a part of? </p>
<p class="body">What I very clearly I saw as is now happening with the VAX debate, was a weaponization of language and instrument instrumentalization of the of those activists that are there to try and fix the problem for political purposes, yes</p>
<p class="body">So I'm like listen I you know what I've done my bit here</p>
<p class="body">I try to be the Moses in the court of Pharaoh</p>
<p class="body">I've gone back to my spiritual guide, who was there originally bit like a Yoda figure</p>
<p class="body">We do a lot of work, by the way, on, as I say, Muslims convicted of high level terrorism offences and</p>
<p class="body">Work with them</p>
<p class="body">On physical training, MMA fighting actually and spiritual guidance to try and get them back to a solid foundation</p>
<p class="body">Less than minus the hate</p>
<p class="body">So there's a guy from Chicago</p>
<p class="body">There's a few in the UK</p>
<p class="body">These are people of leaders of the terrorism wings in prisons like Belmarsh</p>
<p class="body">And they've you know it</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Rehabilitation is a very difficult thing to do, and actually it's the exception, not the norm, but where it where you have got that exception</p>
<p class="body">That's why it's so valuable</p>
<p class="body">That's why it's so powerful</p>
<p class="body">So I want to continue with my brother or manraja shake highly to do this kind of work working outside of my media work outside of my, you know, my activism for civil liberties</p>
<p class="body">I will keep up on the rehabilitation prison rehabilitation side, but more direct more</p>
<p class="body">One on one</p>
<p class="body">Try to work with the system</p>
<p class="body">Try to work with that machine</p>
<p class="body">And the problem is that the mission creep, it didn't just stop with</p>
<p class="body">By the way, with the War on Terror, but you look at that with the COVID</p>
<p class="body">You look at whatever emergency pops up</p>
<p class="body">I've come to the conclusion that there are some nefarious</p>
<p class="body">Factions out there that will seek to use this emergency to increase state power</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, this these conversations that you had</p>
<p class="body">Did you make any progress? </p>
<p class="body">Was there ever a moment where they implemented any of your ideas or or took it into consideration and and use that information upon? </p>
<p class="body">Making new decisions like was what kind of dialogue were you able to? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Have with that progress with the public progress in the messaging</p>
<p class="body">Definitely progress in humanizing people that come from my background and showing that actually there is a different way</p>
<p class="body">Yes progress with policy</p>
<p class="body">I'm not very</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What was their motivation for meeting? </p>
<p class="body">You then like, why? </p>
<p class="body">Why would they want to sit down and talk to you like, say, if Hillary Clinton sat down and talked to you, why? </p>
<p class="body">Trudeau sat down, talked to you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So so the best</p>
<p class="body">So, so the best example I can give for this is like why did Sam want to talk to me? </p>
<p class="body">Who prior to that was very much</p>
<p class="body">In that kind of world where there's a problem with Islam, yeah, I met Sam at a debate in New York called</p>
<p class="body">This is an intelligence squared debate where I was arguing for the motion</p>
<p class="body">Islam is a religion of peace and</p>
<p class="body">I Jan and Douglas Murray both now my friends were arguing against that motion and I met Sam at the dinner afterwards</p>
<p class="body">Now, what happened with Sam is up until that point he'd been being attacked by whatever, like the Ben Affleck example</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, on on the Bill Maher show as being an anti Muslim, a racist</p>
<p class="body">Now take that example put it to governments</p>
<p class="body">Governments are ultimately very sensitive to public opinion, and you launch this War on Terror</p>
<p class="body">It gets revealed that the whole Iraq thing</p>
<p class="body">Was built on a fabrication</p>
<p class="body">Governments are quite sensitive to the idea that actually they are coming across as anti Muslim and they've got strong Muslim minorities in their countries</p>
<p class="body">You need to fix that problem somehow and they were desperate for a solution so they would reach out to me and I think part of it was optics</p>
<p class="body">Honestly, I think that also the people on a junior level</p>
<p class="body">I think genuinely probably wanted to help, but policy doesn't get set at that junior level and even when you speak to the Heads of State, I mean how much? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know how much of Canada's policy</p>
<p class="body">Right now is</p>
<p class="body">Trudeau right, versus whichever faction he's with that is in power</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Think I think it's more the latter, so it's not just any, it's not</p>
<p class="body">Just one man isn't right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It can't be right</p>
<p class="body">No, it can't</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's also when you see their narrative shift and what they say in terms of like mandates and things that they're going to implement</p>
<p class="body">We wouldn't do that, and then that's the norm</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like what? </p>
<p class="body">What do you think is what's what's the main factor? </p>
<p class="body">Behind like when you become is I. I don't know anything about Canada's politics, but if you become the President of the United States, one of the weirdest things about the job is that it's the most important job in the entire country, if not the world. And we have new people doing it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and we have a popularity contest to elect the new person to do it and you could see through Trump you don't even have to have experience in government</p>
<p class="body">No experience, you don't have to have been a mayor or a governor or a senator</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That kind of reinforces the the notion that there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a faction who are meant</p>
<p class="body">To support that person</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Behind the scenes who have the experience, we call that the bureaucracy civil service</p>
<p class="body">That that's why I believe it's never just about that</p>
<p class="body">One person, of course</p>
<p class="body">And unfortunately, what what we're witnessing at the moment, suppose we can come to this later</p>
<p class="body">But what happens when that faction is no longer serving the interests of the values of countries meant to be built on? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Then you have a situation where the state is no longer serving the people, which is what I believe we're in at the moment</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The state is no longer serving the people now this mission creep</p>
<p class="body">You experience this during the Bush administration you experience, so you feel like with every administration it keeps getting deeper</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean the best example is that once I'm example I spoke right, it went from arbitrarily interning the jihadis</p>
<p class="body">Who were meant to be like very dangerous people, and now we're putting kids in jail</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Who are kids of the jihadis who are born? As you know, either taken US 345 year olds or born in the prison and their wives and everyone is like Oh no one wants them back right now. You go to camp and hole in Syria full of wives and children</p>
<p class="body">And they're just running around these camps and they're in prison</p>
<p class="body">It's a camp</p>
<p class="body">Some of them born there, some were 234 years old and they've grown up in</p>
<p class="body">There just imagine that man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Horrifying, you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean, this is the stories we hear about North Korea</p>
<p class="body">And we're</p>
<p class="body">Horrified about that yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">We're doing it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Terrifying, so that's mission creep for you</p>
<p class="body">That's that's a classic example of mission creep to a point where it's become politically acceptable for a UK home secretary to say we're going to do the same too</p>
<p class="body">Undocumented migrants now that's a problem we have to fix, by the way</p>
<p class="body">Our borders, we've gotta work out a solution that's humane to that problem</p>
<p class="body">And it does require a solution</p>
<p class="body">And I do recognize that</p>
<p class="body">Open borders aren't practical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, our situation is even stranger because we scoop everybody up, put them at the border and then depending on what you believe, distribute them throughout the country and on either buses or however they're doing it now</p>
<p class="body">If that is true, if they just allowing people to just come into the country, undocumented</p>
<p class="body">It's like you have to wonder like what's the motivation behind that and what is also the motivation about this push to try to allow undocumented people to vote</p>
<p class="body">So like, are you letting people into the country as a bribe so that they'll vote for the people that let them into the country versus the people that wanted to secure the the borders? </p>
<p class="body">And build the wall</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so are you</p>
<p class="body">Are you essentially stocking your pond? </p>
<p class="body">You know you're bringing in more people that are going to go with your agenda and it's and they're, well, there's all this thing in this country</p>
<p class="body">This is massive contradiction, right? </p>
<p class="body">Where you</p>
<p class="body">Can't have someone need to have a driver's license or identification to vote. 'cause that's racist, but you can have them need to have a driver's license or identification to show they've had proof of vaccination</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but you can have someone come in from across the border and not check them for vaccination, not vaccinate them and not check to see if they have</p>
<p class="body">COVID it's crazy, right? </p>
<p class="body">But you can't this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Is what I mean by politicization all these debates? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's well, it's it's</p>
<p class="body">It's so inconsistent and it's so they're they're both simultaneously existing from the same people where they're they're espousing</p>
<p class="body">One thing that literally contradicts the other thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Why would you do that though? </p>
<p class="body">Why would why would any individual give a reason for doing thing 8? </p>
<p class="body">And then and then ditch that reason and do exactly the opposite</p>
<p class="body">For thing B</p>
<p class="body">It shows you that's not the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Reason, well, one of the reasons why I really wanted to talk to you is because I think your perspective is so much different than anyone else is because of your</p>
<p class="body">Because when you were radicalized because of your time in prison and because of</p>
<p class="body">The incredibly rational way you pursue truth and the way you discuss things</p>
<p class="body">Now I've seen your BBC program and I've seen you give talks</p>
<p class="body">You have a very clean and rational way of addressing and breaking down all these processes that are in place that cause people to behave a certain way you understand it</p>
<p class="body">Because you were radicalized yourself as well, you understand the mind</p>
<p class="body">Play that, I think, is oftentimes</p>
<p class="body">It's known of but not discussed and certainly not understood deeply like you do, and I think that is the key to all of us understanding what's going on right now that there's a lot of panic</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of moral outrage and a lot of virtue signaling a lot of signaling to the tribe</p>
<p class="body">But then there's also</p>
<p class="body">These forces that have been moving in play as what you call mission creep and this is an opportunity for them to push even further in this general direction, and I don't think many people are aware of that, and I think they're looking at it in terms of what their ideology supports, where their their ideology is pro vaccination or their ID</p>
<p class="body">Ideology is pro open borders or pro closed, whatever it is like, people are locked into a prearranged, predetermined group of ideas and opinions that you have adopted that you will support, and it's become almost like a religion and religions</p>
<p class="body">The problem with religion, the the term religion is we always think of it involving a deity</p>
<p class="body">And it doesn't have to involve a deity, it can have the ideas become the deity, the the the signaling to the group becomes a deity</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I think you know that more than anyone</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, this brings us to contemporary times</p>
<p class="body">After shutting William down</p>
<p class="body">Just there was a bit of an overlap, but I primarily became a talk show host on a UK mainstream radio station and we had Collins as well, and COVID struck and I had to take a view on it</p>
<p class="body">I'm double jabbed, and the reason I am is right at the beginning I gave the benefit of the doubt to the narrative</p>
<p class="body">To the authorities telling us what we needed to do right at the start</p>
<p class="body">And I thought you know what? </p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm not anti vaccine in principle so fine you know I had no reason to question any of it</p>
<p class="body">What happened is once</p>
<p class="body">They implemented this emergency law</p>
<p class="body">They ditched all of our rights in the UK under this Coronavirus Emergency Act</p>
<p class="body">Now I've seen that before</p>
<p class="body">That's why I said, we'll come</p>
<p class="body">Back to emergencies</p>
<p class="body">I've seen that story play out before and the problem is the minute the government takes your rights</p>
<p class="body">There are still blowback, legislative blowback from the War on Terror that we still haven't got</p>
<p class="body">Rid of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Patriot Act 
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">In the US, in the UK, the rights of silence is now in any port of entry or exit. In the UK, Heathrow Airport shipping port</p>
<p class="body">It's now a criminal offence to stay silent</p>
<p class="body">If a counter terrorism investigation is conducted on you</p>
<p class="body">The Terrorism Act</p>
2000 has criminalized your right to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Silence, so if you are in investigated or interviewed by someone and you choose to be silent, they just lock you in jail</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">For that it happened to me. So when I got out of prison, the Terrorism Act 2000 was already in place</p>
<p class="body">I was released from prison in 2006. I was interrogated under this power and I was informed directly by police officer. Your silence is a criminal offence, as is refusing your right for us to take your DNA</p>
<p class="body">So I took my DNA by force and I had no right to silence and I had no right to a lawyer</p>
<p class="body">Now what's changed since then is they reformed the DNA part</p>
<p class="body">They've reformed the legal representation, but the right to silence is still that's still there</p>
<p class="body">It's been taken away now that's an example of a hangover from the War on Terror</p>
<p class="body">There's many if you remember, under Blair, they try to extend detention without charge</p>
<p class="body">For 90 days</p>
<p class="body">So emergencies the Patriot Act in the US emergencies are always used by the state for a power grab. It's the nature of human beings</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, it's an opportunity</p>
<p class="body">Yes, it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's an opening that you do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Of course it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's like if in an MMA fight, if someone stumbles, you dive on his back</p>
<p class="body">Why wouldn't you exploit it? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you it's natural there to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, you know</p>
<p class="body">And you wanna beat your opponent so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's a massive opportunity to change the paradigm</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You change everything that's happening</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So when the minute they suspended our rights under the Coronavirus Emergency Act, is the minute my my light started switching on? </p>
<p class="body">Like where's this going to head? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did you use your platform to advocate for a different approach? </p>
<p class="body">Did you say how you felt about this idea of stripping away laws in the idea under the guise of protecting people that this is not only unnecessary, but it's unproductive and it leads to bad things and instead</p>
<p class="body">There could be some sort of advocacy campaign for vaccination or advocacy campaign for doing responsible things and social distancing and not not taking it to the extreme of changing laws</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So look yes and where I'm coming from is back to Egypt</p>
<p class="body">They injected me against my will</p>
<p class="body">In prison</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">With what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean occupations, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Who knows what it was we were taken and you know you've just come out</p>
<p class="body">Of a torture dungeon, right? </p>
<p class="body">And you're gonna fight with them and get sent back to the dungeon</p>
<p class="body">You're gonna let them put out whatever they want in your arm</p>
<p class="body">So we had, you know this, we're in in the 1st place</p>
<p class="body">We were prisoners of conscience under duress, which is why in principle it is against our will and there's no point trying to fight it</p>
<p class="body">So coming from that background, the minute in the UK they started saying if you don't get your jab, we're going to sack you</p>
<p class="body">Right, no job, no jab</p>
<p class="body">They called it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, if you don't get this vaccination you can't travel and then it started going from there</p>
<p class="body">Mission creep if you don't get this vaccination, we're going to have a lockdown only for the unvaccinated, which some European countries announced</p>
<p class="body">If you don't get this vaccination, well, you know we're gonna start looking at whether you have to pay a fine every month</p>
<p class="body">Which some European countries announced and some media pundits in the UK will openly advocating on the airwaves, right? </p>
<p class="body">You start hearing this rhetoric</p>
<p class="body">You gotta appreciate</p>
<p class="body">I've come from the background where I've had to reason myself out of a totalitarian agenda and embrace instead something I've believed I could hold onto and bring people towards</p>
<p class="body">What was that thing? </p>
<p class="body">Well, through the inspiration of amnesty, it was essentially our values grounded in civil liberties</p>
<p class="body">And democracy</p>
<p class="body">I've I have been I've lost a family over that struggle</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, to commit to in that War on Terror, to fighting a war, an ideological war to defeating darkness in the form of terrorism that was beginning to engulf the Muslim mind</p>
<p class="body">I've sacrificed a lot in that struggle to come out on the other end</p>
<p class="body">Of everything I fought for, only to be</p>
<p class="body">Told that the thing I'm defending is going to start doing the</p>
<p class="body">Same thing the state is going to start telling me what I have to put in my body and when, and if I don't agree, I can't travel</p>
<p class="body">If I don't agree, I can't work if I don't agree, I can't leave</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">My home now to play devil's advocate from their perspective</p>
<p class="body">They want to get people to be inoculated because they want to protect the population</p>
<p class="body">They want to slow the spread of this deadly disease, and they want to bring society back to normal as quickly as possible</p>
<p class="body">They see the tools that are at their disposal</p>
<p class="body">And they decide to use the law to try to make it</p>
<p class="body">Forced to try to coerce people into getting vaccine for their better good</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And there's a by policies and consensus on what you just said</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The last time there was a bipartisan consensus on such a big lie was the invasion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Of Iraq</p>
<p class="body">When you say such a big lie, well, it's a lie</p>
<p class="body">What is? </p>
<p class="body">A lie about it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The COVID vaccination doesn't stop infection</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't stop transmission</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In the beginning, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It does reduce, it reduces it for 12 weeks, after which point</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is it only 12 weeks that it doesn't? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
12 weeks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It vary per person? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So younger people don't need it</p>
<p class="body">Of course, for older people, when we look at the studies, it's 12 weeks after which point it reduces to the similar levels in terms of infection and transmission</p>
<p class="body">As the unvaccinated, now that we have the academic papers to demonstrate that, but actually if you look at real-world data today right now England, that doesn't have vaccine passports compared to Wales and Scotland that</p>
<p class="body">And we have lower rates in England</p>
<p class="body">Even the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is on camera saying this thing doesn't stop infection or transmission</p>
<p class="body">I argue with you</p>
<p class="body">That's why England has ditched the entire thing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yesterday, but isn't it because they thought it did initially? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but this yeah yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's why they were the when the initial laws were put into place</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the consensus was that it stopped transmission</p>
<p class="body">It stopped infection and it protected you from hospitalization and death so</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm prepared to</p>
<p class="body">I'm prepared to, you know, on the principle of charity</p>
<p class="body">I'm prepared to assume that's what</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They thought</p>
<p class="body">Seems like that was the general consensus amongst medical experts in the early days of the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">That's why you know many of them that are now</p>
<p class="body">They've come out against these mandates</p>
<p class="body">They they talk about the initial days of it, what it was like, and This is why they were in</p>
<p class="body">Support of this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm prepared to concede on the principle of charity without knowing those guys</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I know there were people that weren't establishment scientists that were saying from day one they were saying there's something wrong with this, but but let's let's apply the principle of charity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">OK, yes we should yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Because we should with that right? </p>
<p class="body">The minute it became clear because this is such an egregious violation of human dignity, the minute it became clear this should have been ditched, it it, but it hasn't, you know, until today</p>
<p class="body">Even in my Country, Scotland, Wales haven't dropped this these mandates</p>
<p class="body">Now the other point though</p>
<p class="body">Is that? </p>
<p class="body">Let's assume that was their intention</p>
<p class="body">I've got a deeper question which goes beyond the science</p>
<p class="body">And that is that</p>
<p class="body">If you've got if you've got</p>
<p class="body">The power to dictate to people what to put in their bodies on behalf of other people</p>
<p class="body">Right, and you're the state, and that's the law you bring in now that I believe is such a fundamental shift in our social contract in the relationship between you and the state that it requires not only a broader discussion, I, I think that requires a democratic mandate to bring in because it's such a fundamental</p>
<p class="body">Change in direction in Western liberal democracies when it comes to the relationship we have with the state, what do I mean by that? </p>
<p class="body">If I said to you, Joe, listen, you've got two kidneys, ma'am</p>
<p class="body">I need one</p>
<p class="body">And you're going to give it to me because the state says you have to look after me</p>
<p class="body">Now if I if I have done that without your involvement without your choice for the common good, and I have the power to be able to do that</p>
<p class="body">And if I the reasoning I'm giving is</p>
<p class="body">That there are people that deserve this kidney and you have a spare</p>
<p class="body">One and that you have to look after other people</p>
<p class="body">Now it could be kidneys</p>
<p class="body">It could be anything</p>
<p class="body">It could be any medical procedure and generally beyond that it could be anything you have to do for other people sake</p>
<p class="body">Now if I want to redefine that relationship because up until now you had every right to say my blood is my blood, and I know someone needs a blood donation or</p>
<p class="body">You know, or an organ donation</p>
<p class="body">I know I should care for people, but it's still my decision if I'm gonna change that and say it's no longer your decision right then it requires a broader and deeper conversation, and it requires I'd say that's referendum level change in our culture</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like Switzerland, has referendums, or it's like Brexit referendum in the UK</p>
<p class="body">It's referendum level shift because it sets the precedent</p>
<p class="body">That going forward, I have a 5 year old. If I surrender this debate now and I'm 44 years old and say yes OK state on behalf of protecting Joe, you can force me to do certain medical procedures because I have to think about Joe, right? </p>
<p class="body">I've surrendered my my individual bodily autonomy for the common good</p>
<p class="body">My 5 year old boy is never going to know what it felt like to say my body, my choice</p>
<p class="body">Now what I don't understand is the cognitive dissonance, because on the one hand we argue my body, my choice when it comes to abortion</p>
<p class="body">And we suddenly ditched that principle when it comes to vaccination or inoculation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the the answer to that is vaccination inoculation protects those around you</p>
<p class="body">That's what they would say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So so peanuts yeah peanuts yeah</p>
<p class="body">So some people have a uh allergy allergy to peanuts it's a minority of people</p>
<p class="body">Right, But it's the reason why and you'll know this</p>
<p class="body">Anyone will know that you go into a restaurant and they ask, do you have any allergies? </p>
<p class="body">Before I order the food, yeah, and the reason they do that is because if there's even a trace of a peanut in that dish, you could die</p>
<p class="body">If I'm going to start mandating these injections, we know that there is a rare side effect</p>
<p class="body">We know that there are some people that die from them</p>
<p class="body">Lisa Shaw was a BBC journalist who died after her Astra Zeneca vaccine as officially ruled by the coroner and written up by the BBC</p>
<p class="body">I'm in touch with her husband</p>
<p class="body">Right, his name is Garth</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now they more transparent about injuries over there they've</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Started to be because our resistance has been very fierce to all of this</p>
<p class="body">England is a bit of an outlier now they just ditched everything yesterday all of their kind of there's a lot more to do, but they've ditched what they called Plan B</p>
<p class="body">The whole idea of vaccine passports because there's been such a fierce resistance to this</p>
<p class="body">So take it back to that point, yeah, so so if I mandate injections, right vaccination? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So this woman</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Some people are going to die because we know that there is a side effect that some people die from this thing</p>
<p class="body">Death is a side effect</p>
<p class="body">Yes, minority of people</p>
<p class="body">But it's like peanuts, right? </p>
<p class="body">Right now it's insane to mandate peanuts in every meal, right? </p>
<p class="body">So, again, back to looking</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, but peanuts don't have any</p>
<p class="body">There's no protecting other people by eating a peanut</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Exactly, so go back to the original because we know that doesn't apply anymore, right? </p>
<p class="body">Beyond 12 weeks, it doesn't even protect people anymore</p>
<p class="body">But let's go back to the original</p>
<p class="body">And give them the benefit of the doubt</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But doesn't it still protect them from hospitalization and death? </p>
<p class="body">Isn't that the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Depending on age, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Depending on the age</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Depending on age, right? </p>
<p class="body">So you know a 5 year old, definitely not 12 year old, no? </p>
<p class="body">My dad, he's is in his 80s like late 70s eighties</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, he's had his boosters</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, you know so and he's got comorbidities</p>
<p class="body">So if the infection fatality rate is 0.096%, like the flu right now the Office for National Statistics in the UK through a Freedom of Information request has just revealed the number of people who died solely from COVID, with no other coexisting illness. 17,700 and I think 31</p>
<p class="body">If my memory serves, it's definitely 17,700 and something total number of people from the beginning of this pandemic who've died only from COVID and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is only in Britain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">In Britain, right? </p>
<p class="body">We were told the figure was in the</p>
<p class="body">Hundreds of thousands</p>
<p class="body">Right now this is all coming out in the UK now</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's a bit of a bit</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Of a retreat from all of this narrative, but isn't the problem with that narrative that so many people have comorbidities and we have to protect them too? </p>
<p class="body">Like the thing about this country is, there's a large percentage of us that are obese</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood. We looked at it right? It was like 40% or something like that, so it's very</p>
<p class="body">Level so like what do we? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Do so Lisa Shaw and others</p>
<p class="body">So you're gonna say I'm gonna sack somebody who doesn't protect the other person</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, So what we're saying is, and this is what I'm saying requires a proper debate because it's a shift in our culture</p>
<p class="body">At least I know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm just playing devil's advocate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I know, I know</p>
<p class="body">I've heard you speak on this Lisa Shaw, who died after her Astra Zeneca vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Was that death worth it? </p>
<p class="body">Because somebody else can't control their dietary habits? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well is that I mean obviously comorbidities very</p>
<p class="body">It's not just her dietary habits, it could</p>
<p class="body">Someone could have like some serious autoimmune disorder</p>
<p class="body">There's quite a few different things that constitute the big one is dietary habits</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah obesity, yeah, right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Though it's their obesity is huge</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">If somebody is vulnerable in any other way, what we've done with every other illness to date is that the vulnerable person has to protect themselves through a number of means, yes, and we do what's reasonable to make sure the vulnerable person is looked after what we have never done is say that I'm responsible for your comorbidities and your extra</p>
<p class="body">Health problems and I have to take something at risk of losing my job that might have a side effect in me and could even kill me</p>
<p class="body">Yes, by law</p>
<p class="body">Because I lose my job or I can't travel, I can't go into this restaurant right now for me that I mean the science for it by now</p>
<p class="body">By the way, is clear, but let's assume this whole conversation is built on the principle of charity that they didn't know the science at the time</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That still doesn't</p>
<p class="body">That doesn't exonerate us from the political conversation that was needed about what kind of society we want to live in, because for me, if you get to a point like New York is today, Wales and Scotland</p>
<p class="body">Well, you're telling me that I need to show identification before going into a restaurant before going into a hotel concert</p>
<p class="body">We've got a papers police society in that case now</p>
<p class="body">You can't go from a democracy to a papers police society</p>
<p class="body">Within one election term, without having any consultation with the public on this, and without having a proper and informed debate about how this will permanently change the culture of our society</p>
<p class="body">And that's for me a bigger problem</p>
<p class="body">I mean, the science is clear as I say, but let's have this entire conversation on the assumption that when they initially brought it in, they were genuine, right, even though now it's proven that that's not the case, but that's fine</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm willing to give people the benefit of the doubt you want me to concede that from now on and permanently</p>
<p class="body">The state can tell me</p>
<p class="body">What to put in my body for the sake of the common good and to continue to do so every six months with</p>
<p class="body">A vaccination that hasn't been tested for any long term side effects</p>
<p class="body">I just have to accept</p>
<p class="body">That the state knows what's best for me and always does the right thing</p>
<p class="body">Now, as I say, the last time there was a bipartisan state based consensus on something so meaningfully wrong was the invasion of Iraq</p>
<p class="body">Now you're speaking to somebody who's been on the</p>
<p class="body">On the on the blunt end of what happens when a state gets something so wrong, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">There is no way you can undo what I've seen in my life to know that the state doesn't always act in our best interests</p>
<p class="body">And there is no way that you can remove those experiences from me now, especially when you're talking to somebody who's been injected against his will in prison, right? </p>
<p class="body">And the ethnic minority case here, whether it's here in the US with the African American communities and the whole</p>
<p class="body">Experience of medical abuse by the state, or I'll move it again to personal example</p>
<p class="body">In Pakistan, the CIA conducted a fake vaccination program on children in the hunt for bin Laden</p>
<p class="body">That's not even concealed</p>
<p class="body">It's been admitted</p>
<p class="body">You can is that Jamie, you know, Jamie, you can look it up</p>
<p class="body">Vox has reported everyone report 'cause they've admitted it and apologized for it. Now in the hunt for bin Laden there was a fake hepatitis B vaccine program on children collecting all their DNA to try and see if they were related to bin Laden so they could trace bin Laden. This is why in Pakistan my family's country of origin</p>
<p class="body">The Taliban blow up vaccination centers because they think they're CIA fronts, right? </p>
<p class="body">So while he's looking it up, I'll, I'll keep telling you this story</p>
<p class="body">You know how the CIA's fake hepatitis B vaccine program in Pakistan help fuel vaccine distrust? Now now you know what is that? </p>
<p class="body">We all do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that on there the fake hepatitis B vaccine program? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And Jamie, if you Scroll down, it may even contain the CIA's apology in there. But whoops, but but many of them do once he got exposed</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but again Joe, the only way this gets exposed is when people like us have these conversations</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, now you're trying to, not you, but you know people are trying to convince me that none of this happened</p>
<p class="body">That the states always had my best interests at heart</p>
<p class="body">I can't undo those experiences and those memories and the treatment to say OK, you were wrong on Iraq and you actually lied</p>
<p class="body">You were wrong with this hepatitis B vaccination program in Pakistan</p>
<p class="body">My family still lived there</p>
<p class="body">OK, you were wrong there and you lied and you did this fake program using vaccines</p>
<p class="body">But you know what? </p>
<p class="body">OK you were wrong there but</p>
<p class="body">Oh, and you were wrong when you injected me in in prison</p>
<p class="body">One of your allies, barbaric, who was one of the closest allies of America after Israel in the Middle East</p>
<p class="body">But this time you're telling me the truth</p>
<p class="body">No, I'm going to question</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying you're</p>
<p class="body">Lying right</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying anyone is lying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But that's a thing where under crisis people do not like people questioning the narrative because the narrative may offer us relief from this uncomfortable moment we find ourselves currently in, and we all collectively look to something to help us out of this</p>
<p class="body">And for a lot of people, it's a vaccine, so the vaccines became this this thing that you are not allowed to challenge</p>
<p class="body">And even though we have this dodgy history with the pharmaceutical companies you're supposed to ignore that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Like religion? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're supposed to completely put that on the back</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Burner well well, this is where again you can't undo what I know about this right so? </p>
<p class="body">Let's try another one</p>
<p class="body">Can you look up who paid the largest criminal fine in history? </p>
<p class="body">Thank you Jamie</p>
<p class="body">Sorry to give you orders</p>
<p class="body">But who paid the so? </p>
<p class="body">The assumption that that pharmaceutical companies are acting in your best interest, just like the assumption that the CIA, when it encourages these things, vaccination programs in, say, Pakistan is acting in your best interest is an assumption that has to be interrogated</p>
<p class="body">Now we know here in America, the opioid crisis</p>
<p class="body">That that that the that the medical establishment was was abused and the opioid crisis here in the states ended up killing more people than</p>
<p class="body">The AIDS crisis</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, now pharmaceuticals make a lot of money</p>
<p class="body">Out of this and so with The Who paid the largest criminal fine in history, you'll probably get 2 results, depending on your search engine</p>
<p class="body">And though you don't need to put in the word who paid the largest pharmaceutical fine in history</p>
<p class="body">You can just say who paid the largest criminal fine in history and you'll get Glaxo Smith, Kline and Pfizer</p>
<p class="body">And the difference is, I think the difference was that Glaxo Smith Kline have paid the largest accumulative fine and Pfizer it's paid the largest fine in one big go</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and you can go to something called the violation tracker since the year 2000 it documents all of the criminal and simonal</p>
<p class="body">Civil violations that Pfizer has been found on the wrong side of and has paid fines for</p>
<p class="body">And so this assumption that pharmacy big pharmaceutical companies are acting in our best interests again is an assumption that has to be interrogated because it's during an emergency where debate is being silenced that it becomes incredibly important to ask these questions</p>
<p class="body">Yes, otherwise it gets snuck in and you can never undo it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And when you were</p>
<p class="body">Working at the BBC, you started doing what you always do is you're questioning narratives</p>
<p class="body">You're discussing ideas openly and objectively</p>
<p class="body">What kind of pushback you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Getting so it was LBC OLB</p>
<p class="body">Yeah which is it's the so they part of a global is the largest commercial radio group in the UK and they have music channels and and what have you and then one of them was the talk radio side called LBC</p>
<p class="body">And I was having these sorts of conversations and without going into whatever you know, 'cause I'm not no longer there</p>
<p class="body">So like that for legal reasons I don't wanna get into what specifically happened</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">What I will say is I was scheduled to go on the very next weekend after returning from my Christmas break in Tennessee</p>
<p class="body">And a day before my schedule was, I had a weekend show I was doing really well</p>
<p class="body">You know, imagine a weekend lunchtime</p>
<p class="body">When everyone should be in their in their restaurants, having a good time having their bloody Marys having their Sunday roasts and I was getting over half a million listeners on a weekend lunchtime for only two shows a week and it went from a graveyard shift to being a really you know respected slot</p>
<p class="body">One day before reappearing this this month</p>
<p class="body">They told me that my services were no longer required, but the</p>
<p class="body">Well, Paul isn't in dispute</p>
<p class="body">The indispensable part is my contract</p>
<p class="body">Was on until April</p>
<p class="body">But I'm not there anymore</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Did they have a conversation with you at any point in time before that where they're like? </p>
<p class="body">Well, you probably can't talk about that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I can't see why that yeah, yeah, but but but I know that what I will say is what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Why people other people outside of my then bosses were upset with me including in the organization was because we were having</p>
<p class="body">I was having these sorts of conversations I'm having with you that that CIA Pakistan thing multiple times mentioned it on my show</p>
<p class="body">I actually physically pulled out my phone and asked my listeners to Google who paid the largest</p>
<p class="body">Criminal find in history and had them call in</p>
<p class="body">Yep Pfizer, Pfizer Pfizer you know so</p>
<p class="body">That kind of conversation where I'm trying to, by the way, all while being double jacked, I am right</p>
<p class="body">I got two Pfizer vaccinations right, so people still throwing anti vaccine labels at me</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and this is the problem</p>
<p class="body">It's like the Southern Poverty Law Center called me an anti Muslim extremist whoa</p>
<p class="body">And they listed me as an anti Muslim extremist at the same time</p>
<p class="body">There's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a database called Thomson Reuters World</p>
<p class="body">Check all the banks</p>
<p class="body">All the large accountancy firms, all the big money firms in Wall Street in the City of London</p>
<p class="body">They all subscribe to World check because if you have a bank account they wanna make sure that you're not funding terrorism</p>
<p class="body">So World Check is a database that categorizes used to whether you're clean or not</p>
<p class="body">When it comes to finances from a terrorism lens</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm probably the only person you'll meet on the planet that was simultaneously listed by World Check</p>
<p class="body">Thomson Reuters under category</p>
<p class="body">Red terrorism</p>
<p class="body">As a Muslim terrorist while listed at the same time by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti Muslim extremist</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But didn't they say Sam was one of? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Those two they didn't list him, but was he? </p>
<p class="body">A Jan was a Jan</p>
<p class="body">The only person you'll meet on the planet that was simultaneously listed by World Check Thomson Reuters under category</p>
<p class="body">Red terrorism</p>
<p class="body">As a Muslim terrorist while listed at the same time by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti Muslim extremist</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, but didn't they say Sam was one of those? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Two, they didn't list him, but was he a Jan was a Jan was listed</p>
<p class="body">So what I did is I sued them both</p>
<p class="body">And I got I won against Thomson Reuters World Check they had to publicly apologize in court, remove that defamation and they pay damages</p>
<p class="body">And I sued the Southern Poverty Law Center</p>
<p class="body">That didn't get to court because before disclosure, they publicly put out a a video, apologize and pay damages</p>
<p class="body">But what that story serves to tell you is that when you question these things today, it's so lazy and easy to throw labels at people</p>
<p class="body">So being double jabbed, they call me an</p>
<p class="body">Anti VAX are</p>
<p class="body">Being a Muslim that had literally gone to jail for my faith, they were calling me an anti Muslim extremist</p>
<p class="body">And this is how absurd these people are that you disagree with somebody</p>
<p class="body">And instead of trying to engage with the substance of your point, they want to throw a label at you and hope it sticks</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And isn't this just what happens when people get into power and by say, when I say into power, I'm not just talking about government, I'm also talking about people that have accepted a certain narrative and find that there's a lot of other people that are along</p>
<p class="body">I'm with them in this same narrative and they have these media pylons like social media pylons where they attack people and like you call you an anti VAX or even though you've been vaccinated the same thing with Eric Clapton</p>
<p class="body">They were angry at Eric Clapton because he spoke openly about his very extreme vaccine side effects</p>
<p class="body">Just speaking openly as a person who was vaccinated and they called him a vile anti vaccine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the question is why right? </p>
<p class="body">And it's to shut debate down now, why would you want to shut debate down? </p>
<p class="body">There's, I think there's a deeper point here, and that is that</p>
<p class="body">We've just we just come out of a time</p>
<p class="body">Where for a long time</p>
<p class="body">Moral and</p>
<p class="body">Let's just say relativism</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's moral or otherwise</p>
<p class="body">Relativism this idea that truth is relative</p>
<p class="body">This idea that that it's all subjective that everything is personal experience that's being promoted</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's no such thing as reality</p>
<p class="body">Whether it comes down to defining</p>
<p class="body">A man or woman? </p>
<p class="body">And we spoke about this last time I was here with with</p>
<p class="body">Well, it was there in California, but with Sam as well</p>
<p class="body">We spoke about the the trans debate in Maryland woman</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's defining a man and a woman, whether it's anything else, this idea that actually truth is all personally subjective</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">When you, when you promote the idea that there's no such thing as truth</p>
<p class="body">And when you shut down debate that is seeking truth, not that it claims truth, but is seeking it</p>
<p class="body">When you shut that debate down</p>
<p class="body">In eight of this idea that truth is relative</p>
<p class="body">Like those for example, who now know the science that the COVID vaccination doesn't stop or or or doesn't stop infection or transmission and doesn't reduce it beyond 12 weeks</p>
<p class="body">The booster shot, by the way is 8 weeks</p>
<p class="body">But having known that and they still insist on vaccine passports, it's it's no longer about seeking the truth for them</p>
<p class="body">The truth is relative, and it serves a purpose</p>
<p class="body">What happens when you do that? </p>
<p class="body">When there's no such thing as truth, you can't define reality</p>
<p class="body">And when you can't define reality, the only thing that matters is power</p>
<p class="body">Your father now with your child children who can't reason like my my kids five</p>
<p class="body">I mean his reasoning abilities are great, but he's 5 right? </p>
<p class="body">It's why you say to the child because I said so do it</p>
<p class="body">It's good for you because they don't know how to reason yet</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and you try and if something is too complex you say I'll explain another time, but right now you have to listen to your father</p>
<p class="body">Don't do this when you can't</p>
<p class="body">When there's no such thing as truth because everything is relative, the only thing that matters is power, because power gets to define reality</p>
<p class="body">And this brings us to the hybrid war we're in right now</p>
<p class="body">And that's why people that are in power</p>
<p class="body">Who are seeking a specific outcome from the world that we're in? </p>
<p class="body">Want to shut debate down what they're not interested in is seeking truth</p>
<p class="body">What they're interested in is shutting that debate down</p>
<p class="body">Because power steps into that void when reason no longer exists and gets to define reality for you from up above</p>
<p class="body">And it's why it's so important in a dictatorship that the only thing you have left when all your power is taken from you is the truth</p>
<p class="body">And if you read Orwell, if you look at 1984, it's why he spends so much time</p>
<p class="body">Talking about how</p>
<p class="body">The power he was writing about in that in that fictional account is attempting to redefine reality, redefine the past, redefine the future because if if you can't hold on to reality, you have no premise</p>
<p class="body">To scrutinize the government for whether they're telling you the truth or not</p>
<p class="body">And it's really it is a war</p>
<p class="body">In that sense, hybrid war</p>
<p class="body">So information in that war becomes your most powerful weapon</p>
<p class="body">Now most people don't have the privilege</p>
<p class="body">Of researching these debates, foreign policy War on Terror, COVID whatever it is, people don't have the privilege because they're working nine to five hour minimum wage and they're hungry and they're and they're just busy trying to live and survive what they normally do is they outsource their thinking on where the truth lies to trusted voices in the media</p>
<p class="body">So it's why it becomes so important</p>
<p class="body">To manipulate the media so that those trusted voices that people are looking to are no longer giving them at least the best understanding of the truth they have, but are also peddling the agenda of power when you're in a situation like that</p>
<p class="body">It becomes difficult to define reality and therefore difficult to challenge government</p>
<p class="body">On whether or not they are sticking to their promises because everything gets shifted, everything is relative</p>
<p class="body">The Overton window keeps moving</p>
<p class="body">The goal posts keep shifting</p>
<p class="body">If you remember back in at the beginning of this we were told 2 weeks</p>
<p class="body">Whatever it was flat and flatten the curve</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Flatten the curve in yet</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, now look at us two years later and</p>
<p class="body">We're still, we look at Montreal</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There's still locked down right now</p>
<p class="body">They can't go out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">At 10:00 o'clock yeah, the goal posts keep shifting and you're expected to forget what you</p>
<p class="body">Were told last</p>
<p class="body">Time in the UK</p>
<p class="body">We were told specifically 2 weeks and then it went from 2 weeks to flatten the curve to we're only going to just wait in lockdown and we by the way we had a national lockdown</p>
<p class="body">Very long one</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, we're all confined to our homes and they said, just wait, we're going to inoculate the most vulnerable</p>
<p class="body">Just think of Granny don't kill Granny, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">So by the way my grandmother died in all of this, so again, I'm not anti grandmother</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I wasn't allowed to attend her on her deathbed while the Prime Minister and all of his special advisers and all of the cabinet were drinking with cheese and wine parties in Downing St</p>
<p class="body">Breaking all the rules which has all come out now in the press</p>
<p class="body">And it's not just me</p>
<p class="body">Many people in the UK went through that horrific experience</p>
<p class="body">We couldn't even visit our dying relatives</p>
<p class="body">And they were partying</p>
<p class="body">Meanwhile, the health secretary caught on video camera having an affair in his office in government offices</p>
<p class="body">Right Matt Hancock</p>
<p class="body">So we went through that whole lockdown</p>
<p class="body">It went from 2 weeks to flatten the curve to OK, just wait until we just vaccinate the vulnerable</p>
<p class="body">Then it was. We're just just wait. We're going to vaccinate everyone over 40, which is when I originally got it right and I'm 44. Then it was just wait until we vaccinate all the adults and get hurt at herd immunity</p>
<p class="body">Then they shifted the goalpost again, just wait until we vaccinate the kids</p>
<p class="body">Now the JCVI in the UK, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation failed, did not recommend to the government they failed to recommend vaccinating children. Government went ahead anyway, saying no no, no we have to vaccinate the kids</p>
<p class="body">You keep shifting the goal posts like 1984 George Orwell</p>
<p class="body">And you keep telling people gaslighting the people</p>
<p class="body">That's not what we said</p>
<p class="body">No, no, no, no</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">We didn't just say wait until we did, you know, vaccinate</p>
<p class="body">No, you're getting it wrong kept gaslighting the people</p>
<p class="body">Shifting the definition of reality</p>
<p class="body">Playing with people's memories</p>
<p class="body">That that serves a purpose in this hybrid war, in which information is the weapon</p>
<p class="body">It serves a purpose because you've got to</p>
<p class="body">You've got to disorient, confuse, and create self doubt in the citizen, so they no longer have the strength to question government</p>
<p class="body">For what they said and what they didn't deliver or what they did deliver when they weren't meant to</p>
<p class="body">And that's how you, that's how you stymie or handicap any opposition</p>
<p class="body">And in the UK, again, because there was a bipartisan consensus, even the opposition party like with Iraq</p>
<p class="body">They kept saying to every crisis the solution was harsher restrictions, harsher restrictions</p>
<p class="body">In the end people, the only way when you're in that situation where you've been locked in your homes where the state's telling you have to get injected or you lose your job right? </p>
<p class="body">When you've lost all your rights, even by law, because the Emergency Act came in and we, we weren't even legally allowed to oppose any of this</p>
<p class="body">In the end, you're in a situation the only way people get their rights back from tyranny is by taking them through activism</p>
<p class="body">You never in that situation the state never just gives your rights back</p>
<p class="body">Now when I say taking them, I mean civil action</p>
<p class="body">I mean protests</p>
<p class="body">I mean activism</p>
<p class="body">I don't mean violence</p>
<p class="body">But that's why if you look at the example of England</p>
<p class="body">Unlike Wales in Scotland there were huge protests and a lot of voices, not just mine were fierce on this to a point where</p>
<p class="body">England had to, you know, they they couldn't, they just retreated on all of this now</p>
<p class="body">And all of that everything I've been saying, you take up masks</p>
<p class="body">You take lockdowns, you take mandatory vaccines and I've only ever been opposed the mandates by the way, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's only about mandates for me whether you define mandates as lockdowns or mask mandates or vaccine mandates</p>
<p class="body">For me it's the force bit that I don't like</p>
<p class="body">I'm double jabbed again to remind everyone</p>
<p class="body">But everything we were saying that mask mandates are useless that the virus particles are millions of times smaller than the cloth masks they were telling everybody to use</p>
<p class="body">That testing continuously was actually making the problem worse</p>
<p class="body">The PCR tests were unreliable</p>
<p class="body">They ditched the PCR tests that lockdowns</p>
<p class="body">Did anyone ever think of what we call an impact assessment? </p>
<p class="body">They're going to lock you in your homes to save X number of lives</p>
<p class="body">Does that kill Y number of people more? </p>
<p class="body">In other words, does it kill more people than we're saving? </p>
'cause if you were opposed to the lockdowns in those days? </p>
<p class="body">Oh you wanna kill Granny? </p>
<p class="body">And my question was if I save one Granny AM</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I killing ten isn't the way to find that out to look at overall death, yeah, and whether or not it changes year after year after year</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, we have, uh, so this is the interesting point, I'm</p>
<p class="body">So since being we'll get to what I'm doing next in terms of my media work, but very quickly I started a sub stack after I my services were no longer required and and one of the things I put up in there</p>
<p class="body">The last one I wrote</p>
<p class="body">Is this idea that this Owens distich the Office for National Statistics that came out with the Freedom of Information request and they said yeah, 17,000 whatever it was, 730 whatever people died from only from Kovid since the beginning of this pandemic, right? </p>
<p class="body">And we were told it's hundreds of thousands, but there is a spike in all 'cause mortality</p>
<p class="body">Now if it's not from COVID</p>
<p class="body">What's causing it? That's a question that remains open the times of London reported that there's been a 25% spike in heart attacks in Scotland</p>
<p class="body">Professor Norman Fenton 
<p class="body">And Professor Neil from Queen Mary, Westfield University in London, part of the University of London</p>
<p class="body">Have looked at this and said there's a five year high in all 'cause mortality</p>
<p class="body">Now, if there's a 25% spike in heart attacks in Scotland that are as of yet unexplained, there's a five year spike in all 'cause mortality but COVID deaths</p>
<p class="body">Are similar to flu deaths</p>
<p class="body">Then what's causing all these excess deaths? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, how many of those people survive COVID and then had heart attacks later? </p>
'cause that is one of the side effects of COVID is blood clots heart issues</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So Professor Fenton and I, you know, I I say he's done the research, not me</p>
<p class="body">All I'm saying is floating the question saying these need answers</p>
<p class="body">He said that that these specific spikes in deaths were specifically</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">After vaccination and were those people also infected with COVID? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't think I don't think so from memory, but I'd have to look at that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause that's a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But that isn't so from memory</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the big distinction when it comes to myocarditis and all these different things</p>
<p class="body">Like what if, yeah what if you have both? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like what if it's an issue that where they got a bad case of COVID even though they were vaccinated? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">If it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What do you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Blame it on that, so if so, so to break that question down, we have to look at with COVID and off COVID deaths as well, right? </p>
<p class="body">So the</p>
<p class="body">The health secretary</p>
<p class="body">And so, by the way, these talking points that you've obviously heard over the last two years, every single one of them in the UK has now been conceded to this whole distinction</p>
<p class="body">Death of COVID with COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just they're doing that now</p>
<p class="body">It's fascinating to watch even the CDC, including the debate about natural immunity</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, every single one of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's being</p>
<p class="body">It's almost like they've gotten to the point where to maintain future credibility, to have to admit these absolute truths that everyone else already knows</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So the health secretary in the UK came out and admitted that the COVID deaths had been overestimated because there's been a mix between</p>
<p class="body">With COVID and off COVID right, we also know that again memory Yep, so forgive me if this is off, but from memory 2/3 of COVID cases were caught after hospital admission rather than because of COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right there, hospitalized for something else, and then that's a big thing with young people, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">They get COVID in hospital</p>
<p class="body">Now if you put all of that together and you recognize that there's 17,000 roughly deaths, only of COVID, and there's this spike five year spike in all 'cause mortality</p>
<p class="body">It wouldn't make sense to say did they have COVID as well when we know that only 17,000 only one death is too many, but 17,000 died only of COVID, and that a lot of these people were getting COVID in hospital, right? </p>
<p class="body">And it's a similar thing like I'm going to show you this can we? </p>
<p class="body">Can we do something the Independent newspaper? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there's this multi</p>
<p class="body">A gold medalist, Olympic Olympian weightlifter from Hungary</p>
<p class="body">His name was Sylvester something, but if you look up the independent anti VAX gold medalist dead, this is today's news, right? </p>
<p class="body">I've got it here as well because I put it out earlier</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You could AirDrop that to Jamie if you'd</p>
<p class="body">Like oh here we go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">There is right look at that headline, see see that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's still ready</p>
<p class="body">Headline yeah, anti VAX Olympic gold medalists? </p>
<p class="body">Sylvester solid, you know how to say his name</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I think Sylvester solenni</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Teacher kvell so he died of COVID age 51, and they're calling him an anti</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">VAX, Yep</p>
<p class="body">Now if you Scroll down please Sir Jamie Scroll down to that, go up, hit hit you have</p>
<p class="body">To you have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Drugeon keep reading</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">To oh OK, so I've got it on my phone</p>
<p class="body">Can I send it to you? </p>
<p class="body">How do? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I do that</p>
<p class="body">Actually you might not be able to because</p>
<p class="body">It's is this on a thumb</p>
<p class="body">Can he air? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I'll I'll try later, hit that, I'll try later, hit the I'll try later and you'll get to the article</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, there we are right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">If you go down to yeah, there we are wild so that that paragraph wild card slowly had, according to the publication paragraph above it, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He contacted the virus soon after receiving his jab</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you see that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So they called him an anti VAX are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Six time World championship medalist had been vaccinated to allow him to continue work as a gymnastics coach</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What he's been vaccinated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">However, he contracted the virus soon after receiving his jab and the headline called him an anti VAX are</p>
<p class="body">And says he dies</p>
<p class="body">Now this is the manipulation that's been going on</p>
<p class="body">This is from today's press</p>
<p class="body">It's still</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Going here not built sufficient levels of antibodies</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So he was jabbed so back to your question</p>
<p class="body">What's causing this spike five year spike in all 'cause mortality? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, how crazy is it that that's how they decide to portray him? </p>
<p class="body">They they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Make the headline they are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, that's that's folly, right? </p>
<p class="body">They make him look</p>
<p class="body">Like a fool</p>
<p class="body">It's deceit, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Well, it's it's this narrative that they want to</p>
<p class="body">Push where whenever someone questions whether it's</p>
<p class="body">Eric Clapton or yourself or anyone</p>
<p class="body">They'll call you an antivaxxer</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">This man was jabbed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's such a yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Now, so why I showed you that is back to that question</p>
<p class="body">If they die after the vaccination, one of the things Norman Fenton professor from Queen Mary Westfield in response to your question at did they have COVID too, right? It's first of all, we know the COVID deaths are 17,000 so</p>
<p class="body">And we know the majority of hospitalized cases of COVID were caught after hospitalization</p>
<p class="body">We also know in his study he says they died soon after the vaccination</p>
<p class="body">Right now you wanna you wanna look at this and now I'm not</p>
<p class="body">I'm not giving you a reason for why there's an all five year spike</p>
<p class="body">I'm saying these questions as somebody that works in media</p>
<p class="body">These questions demand answers</p>
<p class="body">And he's looked at this and he said Professor Fenton and Neil from Queen Mary's and they've said</p>
<p class="body">These deaths were soon after vaccination</p>
<p class="body">This spike right and they're saying their view is they have to interrogate whether the vaccination itself, whether it caused myocarditis or any other negative reaction that's caused this spike in deaths, and that by the way, that spike</p>
<p class="body">It could then be you go to hospital and you catch COVID in hospital, but that's not</p>
<p class="body">The reason you're in hospital</p>
<p class="body">We already know that</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So these are all in ordinary times</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's with a thalidomide scandal that historically led to babies being born, you know, without their limbs intact</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's you know the CIA example I gave</p>
<p class="body">You, with the hepatitis B fake vaccination program in Pakistan</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's the Tuskegee experimentation or African Americans, here we know this malpractice occurs</p>
<p class="body">Right, we know that abuse has happened historically</p>
<p class="body">Now here you've got a vaccine that has just been rolled out, hasn't been tested in the long term, and we've got some alarming figures of all cause spike in mortality</p>
<p class="body">And we know in instances that there is a side effect of death, as in the case of BBC journalist Lisa Shaw, who the coroner ruled specifically died because of Astra Zeneca</p>
<p class="body">The vaccine</p>
<p class="body">So there are multiple questions here that demand answers, but asking those questions without drawing conclusions</p>
<p class="body">By the way, I have never on air discouraged anybody to get the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">People used to call it as a</p>
<p class="body">Calling show members of the public would call in</p>
<p class="body">Imagine sitting there for three hours</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I give a monologue for 20 minutes and then I'm open season</p>
<p class="body">Anyone can call and interrogate me</p>
<p class="body">It's good for practice in debates, but point is people would call up and say should I get the jab magic? </p>
<p class="body">I'd say I'm not a doctor</p>
<p class="body">I can't advise you</p>
<p class="body">I'm talking about mandates because I tell you one thing, I am as a postgraduate of political theory</p>
<p class="body">I understand how political systems work and my concern is more on a macro level</p>
<p class="body">These questions about deaths</p>
<p class="body">What I'm concerned about is that the people who ask these questions suddenly you find they lose their jobs</p>
<p class="body">They become stigmatized</p>
<p class="body">And that kind of behavior I've seen happen before because that's what happens in tyranny when he questioned authority</p>
<p class="body">It's what happened to us, and it's what these great historical literary figures have always advised us to question</p>
<p class="body">Whether it's or well, whether it's the Gulag archipelago, whether it's Solzhenitsyn, whether it's, and we have that experience because of the Soviet Union</p>
<p class="body">Right, we understand darkness at noon, right? These books are catch 22. Joseph Heller about the absurdity of rules and bureaucracy that don't make sense</p>
<p class="body">The entire point of these books is to teach us do not just succumb to whatever the bureaucracy is telling you, but ask questions where things don't make sense</p>
<p class="body">And when people are trying to shut those debates down</p>
<p class="body">That says more to me about what's going on than anything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Else isn't it universal though in terms of like world government, there's not world government that I'm aware of that's very open about what's going on about failures and mistakes and not understanding the information correctly because they were under an assumption that proved to be incorrect</p>
<p class="body">It's essentially across the board and isn't part of that, just managing some sort of large scale</p>
<p class="body">Pandemic with a large population of people and trying to make sense of it all, yeah, and trying to figure out how do you manage that and you have to have two different things going on</p>
<p class="body">You have to have actual solutions like medication and you also have to have optics</p>
<p class="body">You have to give the people the impression that you're managing this and you're working very hard to figure this out</p>
<p class="body">And you've come to some uncomfortable conclusions, and you've made some decisions that maybe you're going to upset people, but they're going to help everyone overall</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So we need to go to the origins of COVID to see again on a global level</p>
<p class="body">Then were they acting in good faith right now? </p>
<p class="body">All the evidence currently indicates no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And when you say they who do you mean? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">By that people in power</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">All the people in power acting in bad</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Faith, the people in power that are interacting in our reality don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, when we're talking about like leaks and emails that have been exposed when you talk about conversations between people that work in the Wuhan lab and those are being exposed to us very recently</p>
<p class="body">I'm under no impression that politicians were aware of these emails before us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So the lab leak let's</p>
<p class="body">Talk through that example, yeah</p>
<p class="body">So one thing we can say, I think quite fairly is I doubt fauci's acting in the best possible way. He should be acting</p>
<p class="body">Right, so he knew about this slab leak thing from the very beginning and the leaks that have now come out</p>
<p class="body">Even the DARPA leaks themselves indicate that they attempted to suffocate this story</p>
<p class="body">In the UK</p>
<p class="body">We have a similar example, Lancet, which is a very well respected medical journal</p>
<p class="body">One of the guys</p>
<p class="body">That would actually the guy that fauces federal funding supported his name's Peter Daszak Eco Health Alliance. He's a Brit</p>
<p class="body">And they were the ones engaged in gain of function research in Wuhan in that lab</p>
<p class="body">Now there was a letter very early on and I was from the beginning</p>
<p class="body">I was questioning the lab leak thing</p>
<p class="body">And again, getting into trouble for doing so, but this is before any of the leaks, but there was still evidence to</p>
<p class="body">Indicate something wasn't right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Bret Weinstein talked about it on my podcast very early on, but he's an evolutionary biologist</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Here, oh, that's right</p>
<p class="body">I had put on my show</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah, absolutely</p>
<p class="body">Exactly, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He understood the actual</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And that's why I got him on my show as well</p>
<p class="body">There's a video of him on my show talking about this, right? </p>
<p class="body">Now, what what happened is that this guy that Valci was funding Peter Daszak in the Eco Health alliance</p>
<p class="body">That's not in dispute that they receive federal funding</p>
<p class="body">Fauci in Congress testified and said it wasn't gaining function so that Senator Rumples 
<p class="body">Sort of hearings</p>
<p class="body">And the leaks have subsequently indicated that they did know that this funding was being used in the lab in Wuhan to make this virus sticky</p>
<p class="body">To make it stronger and to make it you know, work for humans to actually infect humans</p>
<p class="body">Now Peter Daszak again very early on our Co authored a letter in The Lancet, which is a very respected medical journal in the UK</p>
<p class="body">In which</p>
<p class="body">Before these leaks came out</p>
<p class="body">They declared that anybody who questions whether this was leaked from a lab is a conspiracy theorist, and it was signed by a number of doctors and it was among them Peter Daszak</p>
<p class="body">Peter deserts the guy that got the funding to do</p>
<p class="body">This work at the bottom of all medical journal articles, you have to declare an interest</p>
<p class="body">Are there any conflicts and they said we have no conflicts of interest? </p>
<p class="body">So here you've got that these guys wrote a hit piece calling anybody like Brett who questioned whether it's a lab leak, a conspiracy theorist</p>
<p class="body">While obviously it's him Peter Daszak receiving funding to do that very work, writing a piece in a medical journal smearing those who are attempting to uncover whether he'd received funding to do that very</p>
<p class="body">Work I think I'm qualified enough in the human</p>
<p class="body">In in human nature, at least, to be able to say</p>
<p class="body">He wasn't acting in our best</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Interests a conflict</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That's a conflict and that you see from the very beginning of this thing</p>
<p class="body">It happened with everything we were saying</p>
<p class="body">Lab leak, masks, lockdowns, mandates</p>
<p class="body">Eventually, the truth came out, but it had to be thoughtful, so that tells me that the people that were attempting to suffocate this truth, at least not everybody but the people that were involved in suffocating the truth and smearing dissidents while knowing</p>
<p class="body">Because the leaks indicate that they knew right, they weren't acting in our best interests, and I think that's a fair conclusion</p>
<p class="body">To reach what were they doing, they were attempting to use this emergency to usher in a new way of doing things</p>
<p class="body">Vaccine passports, even though in the UK and England at least now, we've dropped them in Ireland, followed suit</p>
<p class="body">Czech Republic has followed suit</p>
<p class="body">But it wasn't ever about you not being able to come in to say into this studio and infect me, because even after they learned that you could still infect me, the vaccine passports were still in place, but they've told us they meaning people in power have told us what they want to do next</p>
<p class="body">So the UK is currently the head of the</p>
<p class="body">G7 group that's the world's most economically advanced countries</p>
<p class="body">And the UK currently chairs the G7 group. Our Chancellor, who does our economy called Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
<p class="body">His name is Rishi Sunak</p>
<p class="body">He's put out this video</p>
<p class="body">This is all my feeds by the way my social feeds</p>
<p class="body">He put out this video saying that what they want to do is bring in</p>
<p class="body">This thing, called the central banking digital currency</p>
<p class="body">They want to replace Fiat paper money with digital money as a competitor to Bitcoin and crypto money, right? </p>
<p class="body">But instead of being a decentralized currency, it will be controlled by a government</p>
<p class="body">It's digital currency, but controlled centrally through the banks Bank of England</p>
<p class="body">So instead of having a bank account with whatever HSBC or Bank of America</p>
<p class="body">You have a bank account directly within the American context, with the Fed in the UK directly with the Bank of England you have a personal bank account and you're given digital money in that bank account</p>
<p class="body">These are called central banking digital currencies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK has already announced their intention to do this as the G7 group</p>
<p class="body">These are if you look up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It sounds terrifying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">If you look up the Telegraph newspaper</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Pretty Googled it, there's a lot of headlines about it, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yep, there's a specific article in the Telegraph programmable digital currency, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">If you can't find it, I'll pull it out from my Twitter feed and we can</p>
<p class="body">We can talk through it on my feed, but</p>
<p class="body">While he's looking for that, I'll talk you through it</p>
<p class="body">So one of these</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Central Bank Digital courtesy currency</p>
<p class="body">That is that the one down below</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that the one the digital currency should be programmable? </p>
<p class="body">See that one there</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, he's looking at it even on the search it says the word programmable top search result</p>
<p class="body">Yep, third</p>
<p class="body">Line down, Yep, should be programmable programming</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">I I was seeing that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, now</p>
<p class="body">See again, there's a paywall, but maybe</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Start your free, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But you can see the word there, right programming in the headline. Now what they're doing is they're saying that this digital currency, once you're you, 'cause you know everyone, knows that with inflation at over 5% is now 5 point</p>
4%, right? </p>
<p class="body">Our Fiat money</p>
<p class="body">The paper money is increasingly becoming worthless and we're headed towards a big disaster there</p>
<p class="body">The Fed wants to raise interest rates</p>
<p class="body">But we're in so much debt that if you raise interest rates, people are going to suffer because everyone that you know we're living on debt as Western economies</p>
<p class="body">So they realize that this kind of the lifespan of paper money is fast coming to an end because of the 2008 economic crash in particular</p>
<p class="body">So they're bringing in these central banking digital currencies</p>
<p class="body">Why is that word programmable in there? </p>
<p class="body">So what they said in that article, and that, and the chance of put a video</p>
<p class="body">Out saying this as well, they said right? </p>
<p class="body">Think back to what vaccine passports were</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, if you don't have your job, you can't even eat in this restaurant what they've said and why the word programmable was in that headline was they've said</p>
<p class="body">That this money that you will earn from work instead of having paper money you have this digital money</p>
<p class="body">It's programmable so that you can't buy certain foods or if you do something that your employer doesn't like, it's all in that article</p>
<p class="body">You won't be able to spend your money</p>
<p class="body">In other words, it's not money, they're vouchers</p>
<p class="body">They're like food vouchers and they can be programmed so that, like the Chinese social credit system, that if you try and use them on a certain thing it won't work</p>
<p class="body">You say you want to buy a burger and they want you to buy bugs</p>
<p class="body">Which is one of the examples used</p>
<p class="body">If you start to try and buy unhealthy meat, just won't work</p>
<p class="body">You tap, you tap your card</p>
<p class="body">You can't buy the thing because you've met your quota that month of burgers</p>
<p class="body">You have to buy something like a vegan</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Meal so it won't just be money in this sense of the way we have dollars or pounds today, it'll be something that's controlled in terms of your ability to distribute it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Which is why I'm calling it a voucher</p>
<p class="body">It's a coupon</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But even a coupon if you have a coupon to buy bread, you can still buy the bread like there's no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But you can't buy see that coupon to buy bread</p>
<p class="body">What you can't do is buy a burger with that coupon</p>
<p class="body">It's for bread</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so essentially so you will have this central banking digital currency, and then what they're talking about in that article that we just pulled up is that they'll say right, and it explicitly uses the words won't be used on something that the employer deems inappropriate or the state deems inappropriate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, we gotta see this</p>
<p class="body">See see if we can find that</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Or I'm just digging through a different article about it too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Gonna also yeah</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Talking about, it's gonna</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">There's pilot programs going to be used in the Olympics coming up in China</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">They've already started it and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right now you do, you feel like you're sounding the alarm, or people that don't understand what the **** is going on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So hey, I'll put it out for you here, yeah, so there's the video</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't</p>
<p class="body">Know if your camera can see that, but no</p>
<p class="body">There's the video there's him speaking about it</p>
YoutubeClip 
<p class="body">The G7 is launching a set of public policy principles for retail Central bank digital currencies, CBD</p>
YoutubeClip 
<p class="body">Central bank digital currencies could be a digital version of money, a bit like a digital banknote that could be used</p>
YoutubeClip 
<p class="body">Alongside physical</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, so that's the guy who runs our economy in the UK, names the Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
<p class="body">And here is the</p>
<p class="body">Article Bank of England tells Ministers to intervene on digital currency programming</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and here's a quote from the article</p>
<p class="body">This isn't the Telegraph, the one he pulled up, but it was behind a paywall, so I'll just read the quote</p>
<p class="body">Digital cash could be programmed to ensure it is only spent on essentials</p>
<p class="body">Or goods which an employer or government deems to be sensible</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Holy **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Now I'm going to take it one step further for Joe, right, so? </p>
<p class="body">The vaccine passport infrastructure is in place, but now we know that the vaccine doesn't stop infection or transmission, but the checkpoint Charlie exists everywhere</p>
<p class="body">They bring in digital banking, central banking, digital currencies</p>
<p class="body">You've got a scenario now that you're checking in and out everywhere you go using vouchers that are programmed and you can only spend where you're told you can spend them</p>
<p class="body">There's another word for that man that's called the Chinese social credit system</p>
<p class="body">That's what it's called and anyone who watches Black Mirror will know what I'm talking about</p>
<p class="body">That's that TV show, right? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, So what they are telling us and might say they who's they people in power</p>
<p class="body">That's the head of our economy, the Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
<p class="body">Second, most powerful person other than the Prime Minister and maybe the Foreign Secretary in the UK, right? </p>
<p class="body">He's telling us I just played it there for you</p>
<p class="body">He's telling us that's what? </p>
<p class="body">He as the UK, the head of the G7 want to bring in for the G7</p>
<p class="body">So a scenario where, like in New York at the moment, because the the passport infrastructure is in place, you bring in that digital currency and you've got this total control</p>
<p class="body">And if I'm speaking to you, the way I'm speaking now and my employer or government, you heard that in the quote directly year Deans me is saying or doing something inappropriate</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly I can't actually pay to come here and speak to you anymore</p>
<p class="body">My my digital currency won't even pay for the ticket because it will be known that I'm coming to speak to you</p>
<p class="body">Sorry your vouchers don't allow you to purchase that ticket to go and speak</p>
<p class="body">So a scenario where, like in New York at the moment, because the the passport infrastructure is in place, you bring in that digital currency and you've got this total control</p>
<p class="body">And if I'm speaking to you, the way I'm speaking now and my employer or government, you heard that in the quote directly, yeah, deems me as saying or doing something inappropriate</p>
<p class="body">Suddenly, I can't actually pay to come here and speak to you anymore</p>
<p class="body">My my digital currency won't even pay for the ticket because it will be known that I'm coming to speak to you</p>
<p class="body">Sorry your your vouchers don't allow you to purchase that ticket to go and speak to John</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And this is where we get into the kind of censorship that we see in social media</p>
<p class="body">That is not</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">You can't have that kind of censorship with the 1st amendment</p>
<p class="body">In normal discourse, but you can have that kind of censorship if you've developed a digital platform that distributes information, but it's a private company, so think about what money is, where you can spending on spending on whatever you want versus this digital currency, which is essentially controlled in a</p>
<p class="body">In a sense, like you have free speech on Twitter, but you really don't</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, 'cause if you go too far or you talk about something that they don't find appropriate, they'll just ban your account</p>
<p class="body">That could be what we're looking at in terms of the what we think of as free speech</p>
<p class="body">Being social media platforms could be what we think of as the your free range, ability to buy whatever you want with whatever money that you've earned</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">We're in a moment in history and This is why I said to you what I can speak to you about with a bit more authority than even the science debate</p>
<p class="body">And I've done my homework on the science debate I had to because I had a live show and I was interrogated by the public for three hours on a call in show, I had to have done my homework and the way you've seen me be able to pull out my receipts</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's what I had to do on the show, but put the signs aside</p>
<p class="body">Like where I will speak with a level of authority</p>
<p class="body">Is political theory, right? </p>
<p class="body">I'm a postgraduate in that, and I spent my entire life involved in in political structures and political activism and thinking about social contracts now</p>
<p class="body">What what's going on here is with this central banking digital currency</p>
<p class="body">If you get to if you get to that situation where you end up with the Chinese social credit system in the West, why? </p>
<p class="body">Why would anyone want to do that, right? </p>
<p class="body">I believe we're in a moment of the Gutenberg press</p>
<p class="body">Go back to when the printing press was invented</p>
<p class="body">Technology disrupts power structures</p>
<p class="body">It always has printing and its invention was a new technology</p>
<p class="body">What happened when they invented the printing press? </p>
<p class="body">The power structures? </p>
<p class="body">Who up until that point were reading the Bible for you</p>
<p class="body">And we're telling you that you got to pay this priest</p>
<p class="body">X amount of favors and he will forgive you your sins, and that became a bribery system, right? </p>
<p class="body">Which is what Martin Luther was so upset about when he pinned his thesis to the to the, to the, to the, to the wall</p>
<p class="body">The printing press disrupted that power dynamic where people could read the Bible for themselves, and they began realizing that the power structures were manipulating what was written to control people</p>
<p class="body">Now, nobody in hindsight is going to argue that printing and its invention is a bad thing for humanity</p>
<p class="body">But at the time it led to war, it led to the 30 years war in Europe</p>
<p class="body">Because it disrupted power so much that people began rising up and it led to this 30 year period of war, which eventually led to the Reformation and the rest is history, right? </p>
<p class="body">What's today's Gutenberg press? </p>
<p class="body">The Internet</p>
<p class="body">The decentralization of information and then, because of that, the Internet, the decentralization of currency in the form of crypto is disrupting power because the way that after</p>
<p class="body">The revolution of the Reformation</p>
<p class="body">The printing press control was still possible, though obviously not to that level, which is why we no longer have those absolute monarchies, but control in a nation state context were still possible to an extent because the money supply was controlled</p>
<p class="body">Now what's happening is that the invention of the Internet with the decentralization of information, and in particular here, the decentralization of</p>
<p class="body">Currency in the form of cryptocurrencies is disrupting those power hierarchies, and it's leading to this conflict now, and we're in a moment when the printing press was invented, the powers that be needed to try and hold on to that power</p>
<p class="body">As the 30 years war kicked off, they eventually lost it, but to hold on to it they became very brutal</p>
<p class="body">Because they were losing their grip on power</p>
<p class="body">Today this is what I believe we're witnessing</p>
<p class="body">It's not about vaccine passports, this was a red herring</p>
<p class="body">To have the infrastructure in place that you can have a checkpoint Charlie society so that when the central banking digital currencies are in place, that infrastructure is already there because people were so scared they voluntarily allowed you to put that in place so that you can maintain your grip on power</p>
<p class="body">Because what's coming around the corner is the decentralization of everything of media</p>
<p class="body">Therefore, of narrative and of course remember whoever defines the truth gets to define reality</p>
<p class="body">Decentralization of narratives, decentralization of the economy through crypto</p>
<p class="body">You no longer have the power to define the story and control the money supply, so the powers that be who are losing that power need to clamp down the clamping down on their own children</p>
<p class="body">Because we are people who are born off the West</p>
<p class="body">So it's an internal civil war in a hybrid war context</p>
<p class="body">Over truth and over information</p>
<p class="body">Centralization versus decentralization</p>
<p class="body">Basically, it's no longer about left or right, it's about up versus down</p>
<p class="body">It's about power versus those who don't have power</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you think if there was no cryptocurrency, if there was no Bitcoin, Bitcoin or any of the other crypto coins that they would attempt to do some sort of digital currency? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think that this is a response to the? </p>
<p class="body">Understanding that that decentralized digital currency is eventually going to take over or has gained far more momentum than they ever anticipated</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I think so, and also decentralized media</p>
<p class="body">Because you can't control the narrative right</p>
<p class="body">See how easy it was to convince everybody initially that the Iraq war was needed, right? </p>
<p class="body">Now you got a point today where they haven't been able to convince people of their measures that they wanted to bring in when COVID struck because it was quicker to be able to unpick that narrative due to decentralization</p>
<p class="body">Shows like this that weren't under the traditional yoke of traditional media</p>
<p class="body">We're able to have certain conversations</p>
<p class="body">Now that means that it's harder to control the narrative and so</p>
<p class="body">In a situation like that, when you're losing your grip and power, the only option you have left is to clamp down</p>
<p class="body">And and I'm so sorry to say, but that means like the 30 years war in Europe after the printing press was invented, we may be be in for a bit of a</p>
<p class="body">Rough ride ahead, but we are literally facing a crossroads</p>
<p class="body">Do we go down the direction of centralization or decentralization? </p>
<p class="body">It's obvious where I stand</p>
<p class="body">I think ultimately, like happened eventually after the wars of 30 years war</p>
<p class="body">Eventually people need to be respected and they will win</p>
<p class="body">They will win this and we'll end up with a better future</p>
<p class="body">But there's going to be some short term pain</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And what do you mean by that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">There will be another emergency, whether it's war with Russia, which is already being played</p>
<p class="body">Up whatever it is, whether it's the crash of the economy, 'cause the Fiat, when the inflation at 5.4%, at least in the UK, it's 5.4%. Here on no self control here as well</p>
<p class="body">If the currency collapses because we're living on printed money at the moment, it's called quantitative easing</p>
<p class="body">We are literally printing ourselves money to try and pay for our debt, which is printing more money</p>
<p class="body">That's unsustainable, so we're in this situation where any other crisis could occur if the gas Putin controls Europe's gas supply</p>
<p class="body">If there's a war with Ukraine, he cuts off the gas supply</p>
<p class="body">There's a Nord Stream 2 pipeline that services Germany, but also other European countries are dependent on Russian gas</p>
<p class="body">So if he shuts off the gas supply, you end up with food shortages</p>
<p class="body">Now you can go one or two ways</p>
<p class="body">If there's riots because people are</p>
<p class="body">That's a perfect pretext to bring in more draconian power to control society, and people will want it because nobody wants to live in</p>
<p class="body">Like with riots, I mean people moving away from the West Coast in San Francisco, in particular because of some of the the crime problems there, right? </p>
<p class="body">So people move away from that</p>
<p class="body">But if you got food shortages everywhere and people end up rioting, it's a good reason to say right</p>
<p class="body">We need more power to control this</p>
<p class="body">We need more emergency powers</p>
<p class="body">We need stronger laws</p>
<p class="body">And so you end up in a situation where crises can be manipulated to bring in stronger and stronger authority, when really what's going on is we're in this crossroads in history</p>
<p class="body">In history now we will get out of this because ultimately to numbers game and ultimately in times like this you end up fighting against your own sons, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's those in power fighting their own people, and eventually the people up by sheer numbers</p>
<p class="body">You know end up becoming the people in power, right? </p>
<p class="body">So in the long run we may well end up in a decentralized world which will be much better</p>
<p class="body">But as I say that to get there we have to get through this period</p>
<p class="body">Of those in power attempting to to to to hold on to that power</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you think it's possible that we won't get there and then we'll wind up? </p>
<p class="body">In a more draconian centralized world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Everything is possible</p>
<p class="body">Professor John Gray at the LSE questions the idea that history moves in a</p>
<p class="body">Positive trajectory</p>
<p class="body">He questions the idea that we're only ever going to get better and his his theory is in the context of liberalism</p>
<p class="body">We must never take anything for granted, but it's why I've been so vocal because everything we've just spoken about</p>
<p class="body">I've looked at this, I've had to reason myself out of totalitarian systems, and so when I see that what I joined kind of our values that we believe and hold dear to our civil liberties</p>
<p class="body">What I sacrifice things to defend if the thing I'm defending is moving in that direction as well, I can see that</p>
<p class="body">Pattern I can see the early warning signs</p>
<p class="body">Hannah Arendt is a German Jewish philosopher was</p>
<p class="body">She wrote</p>
<p class="body">About the rise of totalitarianism in Germany to try and understand it, in fact, was one of the leading and 1st philosophers to try and dissect totalitarianism and how it emerged</p>
<p class="body">And she coined this theory, which is everybody can look it up</p>
<p class="body">It's called the banality</p>
<p class="body">Of evil</p>
<p class="body">And her basic point was she ended up living the her final years in Israel and she was really interested in understanding how ordinary, everyday nice people became Nazis</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and the banality of evil is her theory that explains and and and</p>
<p class="body">The point was that</p>
<p class="body">Actually, good people can do evil things</p>
<p class="body">And they don't even realize they're doing them, and it's incremental</p>
<p class="body">It's step by step, and each incremental step is justified for a common good</p>
<p class="body">Until that, the like a proverbial frog being boiled alive in water</p>
<p class="body">And because it's a frog and its skin temperature changes with the water, it doesn't realize it's being bored alive until it's too late and it dies with the boiling water it</p>
<p class="body">Doesn't jump out</p>
<p class="body">So that take that proverb that story</p>
<p class="body">And apply it to Hannah Arendt's theory of the banality of evil that if you incrementally change step by step, you change society before you even realize it. You've got to a point that it's it's past. The point of no return</p>
<p class="body">If that happens</p>
<p class="body">It's it's very difficult to get out of that without external intervention</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, you see this mindset that's very disturbing and online and social media</p>
<p class="body">You see this mindset from people that</p>
<p class="body">If you had talked to them four or five years ago, they would never advocate denying anyone medical</p>
<p class="body">Help for diseases for something that they had caused, like say, obesity, something that was a personal choice they had made, or an addiction that they had to food or what have you</p>
<p class="body">Drug addictions no no would ever deny medical treatment to those people you would never advocate for that, especially not publicly and openly</p>
<p class="body">And then other an entire group</p>
<p class="body">Especially now that we know what you said about how the vaccine at a certain point in time no longer stops transmission no longer stops infection</p>
<p class="body">Like you're still giving it to people and you're still getting it, so if that is the case and we know that to be the case now</p>
<p class="body">How can anybody in their right mind under good conscience, advocate that someone would be denied medical care because they didn't subscribe to the same thing you subscribe to 'cause they didn't take this? </p>
<p class="body">Inoculation that you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Took right so we know that in Israel when you look at rates, so in terms of percentages now</p>
<p class="body">Not just raw figures, but percentages, the rate</p>
<p class="body">Of COVID is higher among the boosted than it is among the expected</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But don't they have a much higher rate of boosted people? </p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's adjusted for percentages</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, so even adjusted for, but they have a very low percentage of people that are unvaccinated right? Is it like less than 10%? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So you can sample that with control loops</p>
<p class="body">It's low, it is low, but there are still some in Israel, but also in the UK</p>
<p class="body">These studies have been done looking at percentages and rates prior to Omicron</p>
<p class="body">Even in the UK, they found that the rate this is in fact in The Spectator magazine</p>
<p class="body">You can put it up at the rate of COVID is higher among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated rate, not numbers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So what do they attribute that to? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't want to get into the science 'cause you can speak to people like Robert Malone as you've done and they can get into the science here at the questions as to whether, for example, one thing we do know is our health secretary admitted that it is not normal to roll out mass vaccination during a pandemic, because what that is said to encourage is mutated versions that can evade the vaccine</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">And there's a video of our health sector, even admitting that now we were saying that a long time ago that they're all admitting this stuff now, and there's something called AD which is antibody dependent</p>
<p class="body">Enhancement that the virus could indeed through evolutionary processes, learn what to evade while it's still in its early stages of its first wave in its second wave, which is why what normally used to happen is you wait</p>
<p class="body">For the three waves of a typical pandemic, before you start inoculating against that pandemic, but to try and inoculate in the middle of a virus, some scientists are saying only encourages antibody dependent enhancement</p>
<p class="body">In other words, a mutated version that specifically targets the vaccinated because it's evolved to evade that spike protein</p>
<p class="body">But take that science away, right? </p>
<p class="body">And just let's discuss it from the idea that mass vaccination in the middle of a pandemic, right? </p>
<p class="body">You get to a point now where? </p>
<p class="body">It's openly accepted in media narratives now that this vaccine doesn't stop infection or transmission, and there are articles explicitly saying that the rate of those vaccinated is higher than those who are unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">But they're still insisting on the vaccine passport, and they're still insisting on demonising</p>
<p class="body">The unvaccinated now take Canada, a father</p>
<p class="body">Was denied access to his child by a judge</p>
<p class="body">Reported by the BBC denied access visiting rights to his child by a judge because he was unvaccinated on the request of the mother</p>
<p class="body">What purpose does demonising the unvaccinated serve if the science is no longer supporting their arguments? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, what purpose does it serve to say? </p>
<p class="body">You can't have an organ transplant if you're not vaccinated or deny you service in a hospital or will lock lock down only the unvaccinated</p>
<p class="body">Now we know what we know</p>
<p class="body">What purpose do these draconian measures serve? </p>
<p class="body">The only thing that makes sense</p>
<p class="body">In my mind is what we were talking about because they are very keen to make sure the infrastructure is there for the central banking digital currencies</p>
<p class="body">For that you need</p>
<p class="body">A checkpoint society to live in that digital world like China</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So meaning</p>
<p class="body">They need people to follow every step of what they're mandating, what the law is, what they're advocating for with no dissent</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The unvaccinated are living proof that vaccine passports are illogical, so you have to demonize that living proof because you need the checkpoint in place</p>
<p class="body">The vaccine passport</p>
<p class="body">Not for stopping the virus</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But but I don't think that the people that are advocating for this are in favor of or even aware of a digital no</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, well, no, they're not, they're not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Not the everyday person, no, but that's what demonization it see</p>
<p class="body">It serves to shut</p>
<p class="body">Down rational, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But but here's my question, is this a conspiracy or is this a natural artifact of human behavior neither? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a revolution</p>
<p class="body">How so in the wrong direction? </p>
<p class="body">And there needs to be a council</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Revolution how how so is it? </p>
<p class="body">How is it a revolution? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">This is a power grab so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Program, but is it always, uh? </p>
<p class="body">But how is it a power grab if the people that are involved, like say, the the health experts, the people that are doctors and medical experts that are advocating for people to be vaccinated and boosted and for people to and, and maybe many who even are encouraging mandates for employees? </p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of people that have no dog in the fight when it comes to a central digital currency</p>
<p class="body">They don't even know about this</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, So what makes them want all these things in your eyes? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Psychological operation military grade</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Bihou, I'll read it for you</p>
<p class="body">OK, is this the one from Canada? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">No, this is now UK example</p>
<p class="body">OK so we have a unit called SAGE which is a scientific advisory group that was formerly that's the committee that was advising government on pandemic policy</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's called sage</p>
<p class="body">One of the most prominent members on that was</p>
<p class="body">Professor Susan michie</p>
<p class="body">Professor Susan Michie, for 40 years, has been a member</p>
<p class="body">Of the Communist Party</p>
<p class="body">First point</p>
<p class="body">And she's one of the most prominent members on the scientific advisory group in the UK that formulated that's the formal committee that formulated our pandemic response</p>
<p class="body">This is from the Daily Mail on the 10th of June 2021 in an article by James Gant headlined social distancing and face masks. Should stay forever, says Communist Sage, Committee member Professor</p>
<p class="body">Susan Michie now keep that point in mind</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Social distancing and face masks should stay forever, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Keep that point in mind and I'm</p>
<p class="body">Going to make another point, not a real quote, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's clickbait direct</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">It's not directly from the</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's directly from her</p>
<p class="body">It gets worse</p>
<p class="body">Joe right? </p>
<p class="body">Here's an article</p>
Unknown 1 
<p class="body">Here it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Ever in all caps has Communist Sage Committee member Professor Susan Michie</p>
<p class="body">She said we never used to pick up dog poo in the park but learn to overtime</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Let's move to the next 'cause I'm going to build this case up for you 'cause I just I know I said something</p>
<p class="body">Psychological military grade psychological operation I'm going to I, I promise you</p>
<p class="body">I'll establish that statement step by step like this by showing you headlines every step of the way, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The Telegraph reported on 14th of May 2021, in an article headlined</p>
<p class="body">Use of fear to control behavior in COVID crisis was totalitarian. Admit scientists. These are people that left that group's age, and they came out and spoke like whistleblowers, and they said, we were using fear as government policy to psychologically manipulate the public right we call it PSYOPS psychological operations</p>
<p class="body">To try and elicit that fear response</p>
<p class="body">So in answer to your question as to why were people toeing the line they weren't involved in the power grab, it's because they were victims and targets of state sponsored psychological operations from the scientific committees that should have been looking after us</p>
<p class="body">Now that article in the in the Telegraph, I said to</p>
<p class="body">You is there for you</p>
<p class="body">Everyone says that</p>
<p class="body">That's a national newspaper in the UK</p>
<p class="body">It's not even a fringe, it's a national broadsheet printed newspaper</p>
<p class="body">The Prime Minister used to write for that newspaper</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the Telegraph</p>
<p class="body">And as I say, that was the headline use of fear to control behavior in COVID crisis was totalitarian, admits scientists, members of the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour Express regret about unethical methods</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, now it didn't</p>
<p class="body">They use that, but they used that fear to try to get people to comply with what they thought was a good thing</p>
<p class="body">The vaccination, or they're realizing now after the dust is settled that they have regret</p>

<p class="body">Well, it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They express regret about unethical methods, but they're publicly expressing this regret</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, because they've come to this recognition so that</p>
<p class="body">Doesn't seem like a conspiracy to me more than it feels like people under pressure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So this is not me saying it's a conspiracy</p>
<p class="body">This is me saying why did every ordinary everyday people comply because of the fear that was deliberately stoked, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Now we're going to carry on</p>
<p class="body">So we've got a headline here on the 13th of January, 2022. This is this month. Yeah again in the Daily Mail ministers have used propagandistic tactics to scare public into complying with COVID rules</p>
<p class="body">Founder of number 10s Nudge Unit claims</p>
<p class="body">Now the nudge unit is a colloquial term for the behavioral psychology unit in government</p>
<p class="body">It's called Spy B, the scientific pandemic influenza behavior group, right, the founder of that unit has come out now</p>
<p class="body">And he said he regrets</p>
<p class="body">And he's written a column for a different platform called Unheard</p>
<p class="body">And this is the news piece on his column</p>
<p class="body">So he's written a whole column expressing this regret</p>
<p class="body">And he says he expressed regrets that they used these manipulative methods to encourage fear</p>
<p class="body">But it gets better</p>
<p class="body">Why do they use the word military grade? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, so this so far establishes that 'cause it intends not relevant for me at this point, right? </p>
<p class="body">What I'm describing to you is what happened</p>
<p class="body">Why were people? </p>
<p class="body">Scared, yeah, you know you could be well intentioned in doing this</p>
<p class="body">But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? </p>
<p class="body">My point isn't about intentions or conspiracy</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">This is just what happened and people need to know</p>
<p class="body">That they were manipulated, whether for good or bad intention, that they were manipulated in a way that the people that did it are now expressing regret because they know that this is coming out</p>
<p class="body">So they're trying to get ahead of the curve and admit that they did it now</p>
<p class="body">His here's another interesting one, right? </p>
<p class="body">So there's an MP in the in the Parliament in the British Parliament</p>
<p class="body">His name is Tobias Ellwood</p>
<p class="body">He's a</p>
<p class="body">Conservative MP 
<p class="body">Now on his own Twitter page, he announces I'll just read it for you</p>
<p class="body">At no point Googling this I'll just read it for you on his own</p>
<p class="body">He's got a Twitter page he announces, delighted to be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel as a reverse reservist</p>
<p class="body">In the 77 Brigade, an honor to continue serving Her Majesty's Armed Forces, the most professional in the world, right? What's the 77 brigade? Well, you go to their website and they tell you what they are</p>
<p class="body">Groups within 77 brigade and I'll just read a bit here for you. This is on their own on their own website, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">Digital Operations Group provide a specialist capability to deliver influence activity and products across a broad range of communications channels</p>
<p class="body">Web OPS team</p>
<p class="body">The web OPS team collects information and understands audience sentiment in the virtual domain</p>
<p class="body">Right with the extent OSINT that's open source intelligence policy framework, they may engage with audiences in order to influence perceptions to support operational outcomes</p>
<p class="body">Now the question is here you've got a British MP's involved in a military PSYOPS unit called the 77th</p>
<p class="body">Now I'm going to tell you something about Twitter because we mentioned Twitter, yeah? </p>
<p class="body">This is an article in the Middle East I</p>
<p class="body">I'll read a direct quote for you</p>
<p class="body">The date</p>
<p class="body">As it pulls up open here</p>
30th of September 2019 Middle East ID. Articles by Ian Cobain and it's headlined Twitter executive for Middle East is British Army PSYOPS soldier. Part Time Officer has worked on behavioral change projects in the region in the region</p>

<p class="body">A unit formed in 2015 to develop non lethal ways of waging war</p>
<p class="body">I've just read for you. The 77th is engaged in information operations</p>
<p class="body">Look at this</p>
<p class="body">And a Twitter executive is a member of the 77th</p>
<p class="body">Assign soldier and This is why I said to you</p>
<p class="body">Military grade psychological operations, not just any psychological operations</p>
<p class="body">This is why people have become so scared</p>
<p class="body">They are victims of PSYOPS</p>
<p class="body">Intentions might be good, don't you think you I Jamie, your listeners had the right to know this was happening to us regardless of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Intention yes, well this was listed in an article in September of 2019, right? I mean, we did know about it, at least it was published. It was exposed in September of 2019, right? Oh, I see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that was exposed</p>
<p class="body">It was exposed</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah it's it's exposed</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's a it's a leak</p>
<p class="body">It's not a it's</p>
<p class="body">An exposure</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's not at the government</p>
<p class="body">Saying this is what we're doing to you, how did it? </p>
<p class="body">How did they find out about that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Leaks one thing I like about you</p>
<p class="body">You come with receipts, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Receipts, right? </p>
<p class="body">So when I say now I'm going to say the statement again and it's going to</p>
<p class="body">Sound less crazy now</p>
<p class="body">Military grade psychological operations</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">May I ask you like? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, well I see that that is military great</p>
<p class="body">Now let me ask you this, how do you think that is achieved? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think that's achieved through the use of things like the IR a like how Russia uses it troll farms? </p>
<p class="body">Things along those lines that manipulate narratives through paid posers, like people that are pretending to be posters</p>
<p class="body">But they're really just someone who works for a government organization and they push a very specific like</p>
<p class="body">I get very suspicious when I see people with like American flags in their their Twitter handle and they they talk a lot of crazy **** I'm like that might be a fed</p>
<p class="body">You know there's a lot of that online</p>
<p class="body">I find a lot of that on Instagram, where I'll I'll see someone page like someone will send me a video</p>
<p class="body">Hey check out this video and I go to their page like oh, this feels suspiciously not like a person like this</p>
<p class="body">Feels suspiciously like someone is trying to like get something to rile people up out there their whole page</p>
<p class="body">Has no, there's no character to it</p>
<p class="body">There's no personality</p>
<p class="body">There's no emotional engagement</p>
<p class="body">It's like a constant barrage of memes and and videos that are inflammatory and data and like</p>
<p class="body">And I look at our goal</p>
<p class="body">Is this guy in Macedonia somewhere? </p>
<p class="body">You know, with a in a troll farm? </p>
<p class="body">Because we know that that's a real thing, so it's not</p>
<p class="body">Just like here's the thing that we're willing to accept very easily, we're willing to accept that foreign countries are manipulating us</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, right, we're willing to accept that Russia does that, but the I RA we've just seen that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But we're doing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But that's the thing</p>
<p class="body">Like how much are we doing it and how much do we know about like the Renee Diresta? </p>
<p class="body">His work with the IR A when she when she uncovered these hundreds of thousands</p>
<p class="body">Sam did a podcast with her and then I did a podcast with her after</p>
<p class="body">Words and just talking to her about the depth of the work that they do to try to get people riled up online</p>
<p class="body">And that's exactly what they're doing</p>
<p class="body">They're just entering into these Christian chat groups</p>
<p class="body">There was a an article recently that came out that showed that out of 20 of the top Christian groups on Facebook, 19 of them were run by troll Farms</p>
19 of them we showed all these different like your baby daddy ain't **** that was run by troll farms</p>
<p class="body">All these like really wild inflammatory meme pages run by troll farms and their purpose is just to round people up</p>
<p class="body">We're accepting those like wow, we're being attacked but</p>
<p class="body">What are we doing we meeting what is, what are the the intelligence agencies within this country that have a vested interest in pushing a narrative? </p>
<p class="body">What are they doing in this country? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, what are they doing on social media? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Around the world</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">While we're getting blocked and banned left and right for all kinds of arbitrary things like Unity 2020, which was Bret Weinstein</p>
<p class="body">Organization that was trying to put together a very respectable member of the right and a very respectable member of the Left and see if they could come up with an alternative party</p>
<p class="body">They were banned from Twitter for that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Now, tweets, US1 arena. Yeah yes, one battleground</p>
<p class="body">Uh, awhile back in this conversation you said something which I appreciate you saying and it's accurate</p>
<p class="body">Is that having been through all of this, I was able to identify some of these early warning signs and trained in ideological warfare</p>
<p class="body">I have been as an Islamist revolutionary and it's why the Egyptian Government put me in jail</p>
<p class="body">Oh, all these signs and I know how it works</p>
<p class="body">I know how you deconstruct a country for the purposes of destroying it from within now whether it's Twitter and our use of social media platforms</p>
<p class="body">But it doesn't stop there</p>
<p class="body">It includes subversion through infiltration of state bodies by your operatives who are not there to serve people, but who are there to deliver the</p>
<p class="body">Aims of your organization</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And what are the aims of the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Organization, so let me play something for you by Klaus Schwab</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, this is in Harvard</p>

17 I feel like</p>

<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Please do it when I play, just have it seriously because I have a listen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Dumb, dumb, dumb can you? </p>
<p class="body">Get Darth Vader music hold on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">To this</p>
Unknown 1 
<p class="body">I have to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">OK wait yeah</p>
Unknown 1 
<p class="body">Go just hold it please</p>
Unknown 1 
<p class="body">We've got to have the proper music for this amazing introduction of Xing pink, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Are you ready? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, tell me why give me some? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Just the music</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, but you want to hear the audio as well</p>
Unknown 1 
<p class="body">There we go, yes</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">And I have to say</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">When I mentioned our names like Mrs</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of civil economic form</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">What we are very proud of now is young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">President of Alpha, Argentina and so on said he penetrates the cabinets</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">I would know said half of this cabinet or even more half of half of this cabinet</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">For our actually young global leaders of the world are grateful</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">And that's true in Argentina too</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">Well, yeah, sorry that's true in Argentina as well</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">It's throwing out shantina and it's so in France, so maybe it's a president with a young global leader, but</p>
Unknown 2 
<p class="body">What is important for me? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So what you got there is Emperor Palpatine speaking about how in the first in the preludes, the first three Star Wars, how he's going to use democracy to put his people in place, right? </p>
<p class="body">He explicitly said in that quote you just heard what we are very proud of is that we penetrate the global cabinets of countries with our World Economic Forum</p>
<p class="body">Young global leaders</p>
<p class="body">And then gave examples like Trudeau like Macron and it's not just him saying this</p>
<p class="body">This is Tony Blair saying exactly the same thing</p>
<p class="body">Our teams are now embedded in governments around the world, helping them to keep their people safe during this pandemic</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">How to keep? </p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">People as safe as possible protect them as much as possible, but not simply in respect of COVID-19 itself, but in respect also of the collateral damage done by the disease. So we've been really focusing on three areas. The first is around exit strategies, particularly</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">In the UK and other developed countries where we've published papers showing how we might exit and ease the lockdown</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">Secondly, of course, because of all the work we do in Africa with many different governments there, our teams have seen in place are on the ground</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">They're working with the President, Prime Minister teams in combating the crisis</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">And then what? </p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">We're focused on is trying to give them realistic ways of containing COVID-19 without doing enormous damage to economies that depend often on informal working and where the food supply chains are a critical part of keeping people alive</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">And then thirdly, we're working on the global coordination picture because one of the things that has been shocking</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">As I've said, right from the very beginning is the absence of global coordination</p>
Unknown 3 
<p class="body">I think out of this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So that one doesn't bother me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">The direct quote, though on his, as you say, our teams are now embedded in governments around the world</p>
<p class="body">That's actually what they wrote, and the video is 2 minutes</p>
<p class="body">I didn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Play all of it is what he says, but what he's saying there sounds reasonable</p>
<p class="body">Figuring out on strategic ways to end the lockdown easily, but that makes sense</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Four Seasons 
<p class="body">No, not yet</p>
<p class="body">Not the end lockdown</p>
<p class="body">No no no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, didn't he say</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That keep in mind, Tony Blair is the one who's been advocating for vaccine, passports, digital identification through COVID, and all of these measures</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But didn't they say that about ending the lockdowns and keeping businesses and stuff? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Once those measures are in place right so he's even in the UK, his stance is being yeah, we're going to get out of it, but you have to have digital ID and you have to have</p>
<p class="body">So during the war</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then this is going to introduce the</p>
<p class="body">The Social Credit score system</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, so the what? </p>
<p class="body">All of that came from your question, which is regardless of intention</p>
<p class="body">How do people? </p>
<p class="body">How do people do that infiltration from within? </p>
<p class="body">It's not just Twitter, so back to the psychological operations</p>
<p class="body">It's also embedding people in government who are subscribed to this agenda</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and the agenda of Corbyn the world</p>
<p class="body">Economic Forum is the same as the agenda of Tony Blair in this regard</p>
<p class="body">They call it on their own website</p>
<p class="body">They call it the great reset</p>
<p class="body">That's what they say themselves, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's a bizarre thing to do to openly</p>
<p class="body">Why do you think they openly discuss it that way and openly? </p>
<p class="body">Because the great reset has always been this gigantic conspiracy theory among the online folks like this is all part of the great reset</p>
<p class="body">Well, when he wrote a ******* book called The Great Reset you're like hey Man, shouldn't you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Be hiding this and and and in 2017 at Harvard he's saying</p>
<p class="body">You know we're going to basically all of these world leaders or penetrate their cabinets with our young global leaders</p>
<p class="body">He's open, he's open Blair's open. During the Iraq War, Blair tried to bring in ID cards in Britain</p>
<p class="body">He failed, now he's back and he's trying to bring in digital ID during COVID, right? </p>
<p class="body">So they're open about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So this is going to be this never ending process to slowly move the goal posts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Towards more and more authoritarianism</p>
<p class="body">Checkpoint society</p>
<p class="body">It's all there, they told us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This we people have to realize this right</p>
<p class="body">This is important yeah? </p>
<p class="body">When you were when you were on your radio show, what kind of pushback did you? </p>
<p class="body">Can you talk about that? </p>
<p class="body">No, probably can't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So I can when it comes to those who disagreed with me in public, just not the management legal side contract side</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">But there were other broadcasters that basically some called me</p>
<p class="body">Deranged is 1 direct quote, another because obviously this is a whole radio group, so there's other presenters not just my show, yeah</p>
<p class="body">When I said I when I said publicly on my feet, I would not not get a booster and I said I'm a conscientious objector to getting a booster because of mandates, and I I refuse to participate in a system that removes choice</p>
<p class="body">I was called deranged for saying I didn't want to</p>
<p class="body">Get a booster</p>
<p class="body">Soon afterwards, again, it all came out and they realized that the boosters weren't doing much when it comes to</p>
<p class="body">The spread and transmission of COVID, so they publicly came out and attacked me</p>
<p class="body">For some of the things I've said here, in fact I've gone</p>
<p class="body">Nothing I've said here</p>
<p class="body">I haven't already said, by the way, so I've been called an extremist for saying this for having this discussion that I'm having with you</p>
<p class="body">I've been re radicalized</p>
<p class="body">Somehow, apparently this means that I haven't really left the group that I used</p>
<p class="body">To belong</p>
<p class="body">To Jesus yeah, and on top of that</p>
<p class="body">I I need mental help</p>
<p class="body">I've got mental health problems</p>
<p class="body">I'm being gaslit in that way that I'm the one who's lost sense of reality</p>
<p class="body">So when you move the goal posts in that way to such an extent that</p>
<p class="body">That the that the psychological operations purpose is to gaslight the public, as happened under communism</p>
<p class="body">The person who speaks up</p>
<p class="body">Is the person that has psych needs psychological help as opposed? </p>
<p class="body">To of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that is gaslighting by definition, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That's where we are</p>
<p class="body">But as you've seen nothing I said comes without receipts</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, and you know when we were easing into this conversation, I had a</p>
<p class="body">I had a feeling he was going to go this way, but I was like I was hoping I was going to find some holes</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I was hoping like, well, maybe he's exaggerating, or maybe I don't</p>
Unknown 1 
<p class="body">Remain music</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't see these</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Holes so so</p>
<p class="body">Again, remember this right? </p>
<p class="body">For me, it's not about intention</p>
<p class="body">You can have the best of intentions and do evil</p>
<p class="body">That is what Hannah Arendt meant by the banality of evil</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think that's a very good point</p>
<p class="body">That's a very good point, because that erases the stigma that it's attached to these conspiracy theories that there's this grand cabal of evil people that are currently trying to control the world</p>
<p class="body">Do you think that there is a sense or that they have an incentive to try to impart more control? </p>
<p class="body">Because we're under direct competition with China and they have essentially total control over there</p>
<p class="body">The way the Chinese government has control of their corporations and the Corporations Act for the interest</p>
<p class="body">Of the Chinese party, they they act with in the best interest. They don't do any. They're not independent like, you know, say Harley-Davidson or something like that</p>
<p class="body">It does whatever the **** they want when they would make motorcycles whatever you're doing in China if you, especially if you're involved in a technology company you work with the government</p>
<p class="body">You go one step further, OK, please</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I there's something called Elite capture, which is a term that I use</p>
<p class="body">I believe our elite</p>
<p class="body">Have come under the undue influence of Chinese intelligence agencies, unfortunately</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Our elite like who's our elite, our political elite house</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Political elite</p>
<p class="body">Well, OK, so if you look up BBC Chinese spy parliament MI 5 just last month</p>
<p class="body">In fact this month I think it was warned about this</p>
<p class="body">I've been saying it since my hunger strike, which we haven't spoken about, but I went on hunger strike at the beginning of the pandemic because of the week are genocide in China</p>
<p class="body">I did a five day hunger strike to try and draw attention to the plight of the week</p>
<p class="body">I, Muslim community who are facing genocide in China because nobody was speaking about it in the media at the time</p>
<p class="body">It wasn't getting the attention it deserved</p>
<p class="body">And I was a mainstream broadcaster who didn't even turn up to work</p>
<p class="body">Because I was on hunger strike sitting outside the Chinese embassy in protest, the purpose was to get 100,000 signatures</p>
<p class="body">On a petition on a UK Parliament website that would force a debate in the UK Parliament on the genocide in China, we got the 100,000 signatures within four days and there was a debate and the UK Parliament unanimously voted in a symbolic vote that there was a genocide in China and then other countries started cascading after that candidate at the same in the Netherlands did the same</p>
<p class="body">Blinking here is when he was sworn in</p>
<p class="body">After my hunger strike was asked in his swearing in ceremony, he said yes, I believe there's a genocide in China and then America followed</p>
<p class="body">Suit as well</p>
<p class="body">Back in those days when I did that hunger strike</p>
<p class="body">It wasn't common apart from Trump, it wasn't common for somebody from my background to speak about China, it was seen as a Trumpian thing</p>
<p class="body">To do right</p>
<p class="body">And people often forget how that was in those days and dumb</p>
<p class="body">I mentioned back then that the reason I think this genocide was being not getting the attention it deserved in the press was because our elite had come under the armed do influence of Chinese state</p>
<p class="body">CCP, right, Communist Party, not the Chinese people, but the states influence operations in the West and they had somehow captured our elite</p>
<p class="body">To head in a direction that serves the interests of China</p>
<p class="body">Now what's come out since then, it's it's now two years later</p>
<p class="body">Again, like with everything else I've spoken about, it's now in the press, so there's an article in the BBC MI 5 warning over Chinese agent in Parliament</p>
<p class="body">That's from the 13th of January this month</p>
<p class="body">Month now that this lady here she's been operating with senior parliamentarians as an active spy of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p class="body">At to the point where our security services, the internal branch MI Five, had issued a rare warning as it says</p>
<p class="body">At the top right</p>
<p class="body">And she's not the only one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I want to read it for people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">That are just listening like 5 has issued a rare warning that an alleged Chinese agent has infiltrated Parliament to interfere in UK politics and alert from the Security Service, said Christine Chinqua Lee</p>
<p class="body">I hope I pronounced that correctly established links for the Chinese Communist Party, CCP with current and aspiring MPs</p>
<p class="body">She then gave donations to politicians with funding</p>
<p class="body">Coming from forward nationals in China and Hong Kong specifically go down, we go down to the next few paragraphs there</p>
<p class="body">One of the MP's funded by Miss Lee was Labour's Barry Gardner right so this is</p>
<p class="body">Our opposition party, who received over £420,000. That's half $1,000,000</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, from her in five years, but he said he's always made the security services aware of the donations. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also received a £5000 donation, so a lot less</p>
<p class="body">Those two parties, by the way, were very much in favor of all of the COVID mandates, and we know that the idea of lockdowns began in China</p>
<p class="body">We know that the virus leaked from Wuhan</p>
<p class="body">We know that China has an interest in making sure that the world follows its ideology</p>
<p class="body">A bit like in the Cold War with the Soviet Union wanted us to be communists</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But can you really buy the influence of these politicians for $100,000 a year to the point where they're willing to instigate these sort of COVID lockdowns? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">What you do is you don't</p>
<p class="body">They don't think they're being bought, they think they're receiving money from a donor, and they're serving their donors interests like a lobby</p>
<p class="body">That's how the lobby works</p>
<p class="body">It's why so they have discussions with them</p>
<p class="body">It's like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">About an agenda</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, yeah, and it's like you know</p>
<p class="body">So when I first started speaking about the wiegard genocide, it was seen as racist against the Chinese to speak about</p>
<p class="body">The Communist influence of China in the West, right? </p>
<p class="body">So you don't need to say don't you don't need to say to somebody</p>
<p class="body">Here's some money</p>
<p class="body">Do the bidding of the CCP you</p>
<p class="body">Need to say I'm I'm funding you as a British Chinese citizen when actually they're working for the CCP</p>
<p class="body">I'm worried about increasing anti Chinese racism</p>
<p class="body">Again, a legitimate concern to have</p>
<p class="body">I'm going to provide money to your party and let's</p>
<p class="body">Start trying to divert conversation away from criticizing Chinese actions because it will lead to anti Chinese racism unless instead speak about the need for wowway the contract with wowway the 5G networks. So it's why we had this problem where</p>
<p class="body">So difficult to cancel those wowway contracts, but we ended up canceling them in the end after we agreed to have them because all of this got exposed</p>
<p class="body">After that hunger</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying I'm the reason it got exposed, I'm saying it was</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">In chronological order</p>
<p class="body">Just to reassure people that what I say isn't just something that I've just plucked out of my head is actually then it gets reported in the press</p>
<p class="body">It's happening, so the concern around China's influence in terms of not only our tech wowway and others and the ability to enter our information through the back door through the wowway 5G networks, which have since been canceled since Trump</p>
<p class="body">And in the UK we followed America and cancelled those pending contracts</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't just apply to tech, it doesn't just apply to</p>
<p class="body">Pro lockdown messaging in Parliament, but you look to our we've got a nuclear reactor in the UK called Hinkley Point C</p>
<p class="body">It's being built with Chinese funding</p>
<p class="body">Now I'm asking you to countries engaged in a genocide against a community for their beliefs</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't tolerate diversity, and you're letting that nation controlled by the CCP</p>
<p class="body">Work on our sensitive nuclear programs now I wouldn't do that with the Soviet Union</p>
<p class="body">And what I don't understand, moving this conversation slightly to foreign policy is why are we? </p>
<p class="body">Why are we not realizing that we've got this kind of consensus developing with the Biden administration, that Putin and Russia are a threat when actually you got a bigger problem here with the CCP far more powerful than Russia, far more organized, have far more centralized control, and are far wealthier</p>
<p class="body">And their military is far stronger</p>
<p class="body">And we go real elephant in the room, and that is the increasing power of the CCP ruled China</p>
<p class="body">The influence isn't just military, but it's also soft power, so when the lockdowns first began, I signed a joint letter with other signatories up and one of the signatories was General Spalding. Here at US general</p>
<p class="body">And it was</p>
<p class="body">It's on the web</p>
<p class="body">It's online still, and we directly alleged that influence Chinese influence operations have been responsible for a lot of this idea that lockdowns were our solution</p>
<p class="body">It was the First Nation that implemented lockdowns and then Italy in Europe followed after China and then the rest of Europe followed after that, and Michael Singer, who's one of the signatories to that letter</p>
<p class="body">Has written an extensive book on this tracing step by step</p>
<p class="body">The way I've gone through receipts with you here</p>
<p class="body">He's gone through step by step these influence operations where the CCP have been encouraging a draconian response to COVID and all of this technocracy that is eventually going to arise in the form of Checkpoint Charlie Society and central banking digital currencies</p>

<p class="body">I see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They've been encouraging</p>
<p class="body">Other nations to implement these</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Their model</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And how do they get away with that? </p>
<p class="body">Like how how do these other nations comply? </p>
<p class="body">They comply because of influence</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Influence operations funding intelligence operations as you see</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And because of that, they're willing to impart laws that they would not normally do</p>
<p class="body">The governments that they're being influenced</p>
<p class="body">The governments like, whether whether it's Great Britain, whether it's United States</p>
<p class="body">These governments are being influenced in your mind</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">With the help of</p>
<p class="body">The agenda coming from other non state actors such as the World Economic Forum and their teams</p>
<p class="body">Penetrating cabinets across the world as Klaus, Rob said, there are some supranational interests here that exists above the nation state</p>
<p class="body">Working as I said to a power grab, working to define the future in a certain direction, and that is to make sure that decentralization doesn't happen</p>
<p class="body">The mother of centralization is the CCP</p>
<p class="body">So we're at a crossroads</p>
<p class="body">Historically, we can either move towards decentralization and people power</p>
<p class="body">Which means local governments, decentralized power, community, family and a separation of powers</p>
<p class="body">Or we move in the CCP direction and there's a term for this in political science</p>
<p class="body">It's called the Thucydides trap</p>
<p class="body">How does a rising power overtaken existing power rising power China existing power America? </p>
<p class="body">How does a rising power overtaken existing power without war, the term, the term the cities trap, is a term to describe that, historically, whenever we've been in this moment</p>
<p class="body">War has happened</p>
<p class="body">Because nobody sits by quietly and allows for that rising power to take them over</p>
<p class="body">So we're in that moment now and our our challenge is how do we navigate this facilities trap moment with the rise of China without us going to war with China, but also stave off their influence? </p>
<p class="body">But that's the moment I believe we are in in history, and I'll just say</p>
<p class="body">With form I know how long we have, by the way</p>
<p class="body">And I'm talking a lot about this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We basically just hit the three hour</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Mark Cool, I mean I don't know how long you're comfortable with talking, but I'm I'm happy to start whenever you want me to the situation now in Ukraine</p>
<p class="body">I believe it's a folly</p>
<p class="body">Russia and Putin of course, like you know all governments</p>
<p class="body">They have their own interests, their own agendas</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, but what we really should be looking at isn't throwing Russia further into the bosom of China, which is what we're doing at the moment</p>
<p class="body">You've got a Russia China alliance against us</p>
<p class="body">Surely if we're going to be clever, we need to be able to</p>
<p class="body">Who's diplomacy with Putin and separate Russia from China? </p>
<p class="body">Because the big agenda date danger is China, not Russia</p>
<p class="body">Russia isn't our friend, but the bigger danger is China</p>
<p class="body">The way we're behaving at the moment, whether it's with the Ukraine or in Syria</p>
<p class="body">Is we're pushing that alliance closer? You've got Iran, Russia, China and they've got cooperation with Biden's screw up in Afghanistan and not the fact we withdrew</p>
<p class="body">I've never been for the war as we've discussed, but the way he withdrew the Taliban now have more Black Hawk helicopters than the entire British Army because of Biden, right? </p>
<p class="body">The background air base that was the American base in Afghanistan, the Daily Mail reported and you can look it up if you want to, but I'll just tell you, the Daily Mail reported that Chinese military have now landed at Bagram</p>
<p class="body">So you've got this axis developing Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban</p>
<p class="body">If we're going to be clever, we've got to realize this rising block</p>
<p class="body">It's not in our interests for them to stay united in that way</p>
<p class="body">We should be attempting diplomacy with Russia and focusing on China as a rising concern because unlike Russia, not only does China have a stronger economy and a stronger military, those things I can handle</p>
<p class="body">The problem I've got is China is stronger</p>
<p class="body">Ideologically it has a alternative consensus about that crossroads</p>
<p class="body">We're at China, has a centralized system, and it has soft power to advocate for that centralized system</p>
<p class="body">It believes in itself and its technocracy and its social credit system</p>
<p class="body">In other words, it's like the Soviet Union</p>
<p class="body">It has the ability to sell itself because it's cohesive</p>
<p class="body">Russia doesn't have that centralized social credit system</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't have that</p>
<p class="body">You know thing that the Chinese have with that kind of strong centralized power with an ideology behind it</p>
<p class="body">Russia is a traditional country, not an ideological country, at least since the collapse of the Soviet Union</p>
<p class="body">What we should be worried about is the ideological country because ideologies peddle soft power and they influence minds with their agenda</p>
<p class="body">And they influence narratives and what we've missed because we aren't in the West attuned to ideological warfare</p>
<p class="body">We've missed that bit</p>
<p class="body">We've missed the fact that the CCP has been influencing through its narratives</p>
<p class="body">It's been influencing the world in this hybrid war way with its disinformation campaigns</p>
<p class="body">A lot of these fake accounts on Twitter, by the way, Twitter themselves have convinced that a lot of them were run by the CCP</p>
<p class="body">And and so this disinformation is being peddled from that side</p>
<p class="body">If we could divide Russia from China, we stand a stronger chance in that facilities trap moment of the rise of China</p>
<p class="body">How to how to navigate around then? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I feel like you and I can have another 15 of these three hour conversation, so we gotta do this again</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Can I quickly tell you? </p>
<p class="body">Why I'm? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes please</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Doing this, yeah so having</p>
<p class="body">How do I put this diplomatically having had my services no longer required, perfect for my mainstream media? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You should have a podcast and I know I've said that to a billion people and I'm gonna say it to you because I think you more than anybody</p>
<p class="body">Would are qualified for this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I I will, I'll be on so that's what I wanted to tell you</p>
<p class="body">So there's three things I'm going to do</p>
<p class="body">I'm having my service is no longer being required on that</p>
<p class="body">On that talk show, so I'm working with Odyssey</p>
<p class="body">Which is a online video platform like YouTube? </p>
<p class="body">Yes, but it's decentralized</p>
<p class="body">So the videos sit on a blockchain so that YouTube yesterday took down</p>
<p class="body">Dan Bongino show</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and they took it down</p>
<p class="body">Took it down suspended and they took down trigonometry</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, OK, when they they take these down they're taking them down for a specific period</p>
<p class="body">Of time or forever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know, but that's why I decided</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I I know that trigonometry thing I heard Jordan Peterson told me about that last night I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Was shocked so I thought I'm not going to go down that route in the first place</p>
<p class="body">Then we are banned, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Permanently bans demonja</p>
<p class="body">What did he say? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How this works? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Who knows? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, so when so he violated the rules by trying to evade a previous suspension</p>
<p class="body">I think it says the Fox host uploaded a video to his main channel while his secondary channel, which primarily hosted short clips from his digital radio show</p>
<p class="body">Was actively suspended for violating YouTube's COVID-19 misinformation policy. When a channel receives a strike, it is against our terms of services to post content or use another channel to circumvent the suspension</p>
<p class="body">OK, well that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Meanwhile, meanwhile, newspapers can say Antivaxxer dies while he's vaccinated and there's no repercussions for that, right right, anyway? </p>
<p class="body">So the point is whether it's him, whether it's triggernometry they've been taken down, so I didn't want to go down that route</p>
<p class="body">So I've I've been speaking to Odyssey as a Julian is their CEO, and he's been very kind</p>
<p class="body">And I'm going to put my show on this other platform called Odyssey, which is decentralized</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is inbred show on that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">As well, I think so yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then there's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's called radical with magic numbers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This rumble, which is another platform that's more open</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">So I spoke to those guys too, but I think with me with Odyssey it's built on the blockchain tech yes and rumble I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it's it's videos are decentralized in that way, so even if the Odyssey websites removed the library blockchain, check that those videos sit on, stay on the blockchain, and I will then</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I see what you're saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">I own my own content, so that's my idea</p>
<p class="body">I think I want to live by example if I if I'm worried about going either in a centralized direction with the planet, or a decentralized direction, I want to try and move my own media content in the decentralized way</p>
<p class="body">And the other thing I've got is that sub stack which I set up as soon as I lost my my gig</p>
<p class="body">And I do sort of written content on there, and finally I'll be doing some collaboration with Getter</p>
<p class="body">As an alternative to Twitter, just to try and have that diversity on the Twitter space, I'll be doing some videos and live streaming and and tweet contents on on getter as well</p>
<p class="body">But that's those three odyssey Substracting Getter will be where people will be able to find me the contents called radical whether it's on Odyssey's radical with margin. Now was on sub stack. It's called the radical dispatch</p>
<p class="body">And my name on ghetto you can find me on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">There as well, Majid, I appreciate you</p>
<p class="body">So this was everything I wanted and more</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Thank you brother</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm so glad we did it and we will do it again</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Maajid Nawaz </h4> 
<p class="body">Thanks for having me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">My pleasure</p>
<p class="body">Thank you very very much</p>
<p class="body">Alright, you heard it folks</p>

<p class="body">Bye everybody</p>
