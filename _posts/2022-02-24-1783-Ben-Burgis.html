<p class="body">The Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p class="body">Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by Night, all day.</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So this is for you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Hello, thank you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So much your own</p>
<p class="body">It's got a little Jerry label on the back of it</p>
<p class="body">This is your own, but in the side this little thing</p>
<p class="body">Oh yeah, this is a part of a thing we did with fight for the forgotten, which is</p>
<p class="body">I don't know if you know what that is, but it's a charity that my friend Justin Wren put together</p>
<p class="body">It's they build wells for people in the pygmy pygmy population in Uganda and in the Congo as well</p>
<p class="body">And so they did a thing with Buffalo trace where</p>
<p class="body">We picked out one very specific batch and they they literally gave us a barrel of whiskey so we have what's one giant bottle and then a bunch of these bottles to give out to guests</p>
<p class="body">So there</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You go nice</p>
<p class="body">Oh man, this feels strange</p>
<p class="body">I you know I, I've got to tell you</p>
<p class="body">In the late 90s, I watched News Radio all the time so you know, get the you know</p>
<p class="body">Feels feels weird having a</p>
<p class="body">Drink with you, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It feels weird just being me so</p>
<p class="body">It's it's weird for both</p>
<p class="body">It's weird for people to feel weird to meet me, so that's that's odd too</p>
<p class="body">So your book is speaks to my</p>
<p class="body">Heart, did you bring a copy? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Ah, I did</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You have a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Book with you</p>
<p class="body">No, I have a book with me</p>
<p class="body">This is a this is a book by my friend Adolph Reed</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's about growing up in New Orleans under Jim Crow and like kind of how</p>
<p class="body">The South and the country has changed and how it hasn't changed, so this is good stuff, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, cool, well that's a good book too, but tell everybody about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Your book, yeah, so my book is called canceling comedians while the world burns, a critique of the contemporary left and I wrote that a while ago, so that was before we went through this like surreal experience where</p>
<p class="body">During weeks that the United States and Russia have been like closer to the brink of war than the Cuban missile crisis, you know than they have been since the Cuban missile crisis</p>
<p class="body">Somehow we've had new weeks of news cycle about Joe Rogan, you know, I</p>
<p class="body">Don't know, I don't know how that happened</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm a controversial character, apparently</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Apparently, at apparently those controversies are the most important thing in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The world, well, the most important thing in the world in media is ratings, and unfortunately</p>
<p class="body">Outrage is what sells and if you could be upset at something and so there's like a perfect storm with me</p>
<p class="body">First of all, it was questioning the COVID narrative and then it was having on doctors who also questioned the COVID narrative</p>
<p class="body">And then it was me getting COVID and recovering very quickly, but taking the wrong medication in their eyes</p>

<p class="body">From here</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then it was, you know, like posting up the brought to you by Pfizer videos and like showing like these, these people like bought and paid for by pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p class="body">And then</p>
<p class="body">It's all the other things</p>
<p class="body">It's like every clip that we talked about before the podcast, like every clip that I've ever said, taken out of context and if you smush em all together how horrible it looks, but it's not really, it's</p>
<p class="body">It's not really that they think it's important, it's they don't give a **** what's important, they're just trying to stay alive and they're trying to get as many views as possible and they're trying to escape what is</p>
<p class="body">This is undeniable</p>
<p class="body">The demise of modern mainstream news</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's the yeah we're talking about this a little bit before before we started and</p>
<p class="body">I think what's really, I mean, whatever, this is not like a mind shatteringly original insight or whatever</p>
<p class="body">You know lots of people have said this, but I think what's really gone on is that the economic collapse of traditional media has meant</p>
<p class="body">That the profit incentive now is just to cater to whoever you have left, right? </p>
<p class="body">So if you have</p>
<p class="body">You know, like if you're on Fox</p>
<p class="body">Bucks then, like you know, whatever like couple million conservative old people</p>
<p class="body">Or you know, watching any given time you want to give them the narrative that's going to keep them scared and angry</p>
<p class="body">And watching the news if you're on MSNBC</p>
<p class="body">Then you know you spend the entire Trump years talking about Russia</p>
<p class="body">You know, 'cause like, that's what like, that's what scares their audience</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and people don't, you know</p>
<p class="body">And one thing that that really disturbs me about this, I mean like the book is about all of the things that people who I basically agree with are getting wrong, right? </p>
<p class="body">So in other words, like I'm a socialist, I'm a columnist for Jacobin magazine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You are straight up socialist</p>
<p class="body">Are you a democratic socialist? </p>
'cause I know that you've been represented as a democratic socialist</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so I mean look</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like what do you what is? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">The reason I put democratic in there, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know which you know which I which I do</p>
<p class="body">But you know the reason I put democratic</p>
<p class="body">In there is</p>
<p class="body">Because there are obviously countries that have existed that have, you know, called themselves socialist that have</p>
<p class="body">You know not had things that I care about, like in a free speech</p>
<p class="body">And you know, multiparty elections and and and so</p>
<p class="body">I certainly don't want to associate myself with that, but look</p>
<p class="body">I mean, short term I care very much about, you know having</p>
<p class="body">You know socialized healthcare</p>
<p class="body">About about having you know, like tuition, free, higher education so people can go to school without being having to be in debt for like</p>
<p class="body">Decades, which is obscene</p>
<p class="body">I mean, that's ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm with you 100% on both those things</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know and</p>
<p class="body">And I do think that like the let the level of inequality that we get from our current system is indefensible, that in other words, that if one person has more than another just because they chose to work harder</p>
<p class="body">Then like, that's one thing, right? </p>
<p class="body">I could you know, like, right, that you know I would</p>
<p class="body">You know person A wants to stay home and watch Netflix</p>
<p class="body">And you know person B</p>
<p class="body">You know one wants to work</p>
<p class="body">For for more hours than like you know person, you know person B should get more money</p>
<p class="body">I am totally fine with that</p>
<p class="body">But what bothers me is when you have these massive inequalities that have huge effects on people's lives, they're linked to things that they aren't under their control, and I think we have a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Lot of that too. I would agree with you 100% my position</p>
<p class="body">On this, whenever people push back against the concept of socialism, or when I was supporting Bernie Sanders or President, I was saying that we look at all the things that are technically a socialist concept that we accept like the fire department</p>
<p class="body">Imagine if you had to have money to get your fire put out</p>
<p class="body">Like we don't think that like if your house burns down we call the fire department</p>
<p class="body">They show up our taxes, fund the fire department</p>
<p class="body">That is essentially a socialist endeavor</p>
<p class="body">Socialist institution</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's it's taken outside of the it's taken outside of the market</p>
<p class="body">It's provided just as like a right that you should have just for just for being a person, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know you shouldn't have to do anything special</p>
<p class="body">To get your house put out if it's on fire and you also shouldn't have to do anything special to get treatment</p>
<p class="body">If you're sick to to go to to go to College in the 1st place, it seems to be that a lot of people who like don't think that there should be a higher minimum wage or the same people who will go turn around and say, oh, if they wanted to make more money, they should go back to school, but then they don't want to pay for that, right so? </p>
<p class="body">Which exactly which one? </p>
<p class="body">Is it right? </p>
<p class="body">Should they be paid more doing what they're doing? </p>
<p class="body">Or should they go back to school? </p>
'cause if it's none of the above, then it sounds like you just don't think those people should have like good lives, or at least you don't have</p>
<p class="body">A plan to help them have good lives</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4>

<p class="body">One free year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. That's athleticgreens.com/what's fascinating to me, too, is when you look at public school versus public services like the Fire Department Fire Department, people get paid</p>
<p class="body">Well, it's a good job if you're a member of the fire department</p>
<p class="body">I have friends that are in the fire department</p>
<p class="body">It's good benefits. The hours are cool because you get to work like 24 hour shifts. You sleep there, you work there</p>
<p class="body">You like my friend? </p>
<p class="body">Ray was a fire fireman for years and he would say like he worked like a few days a week</p>
<p class="body">And then you know they were long shifts</p>
<p class="body">And they weren't always called to fires, so sometimes they're just cooking and working out and hanging out around the Firehouse</p>
<p class="body">But it's a great job, it's</p>

<p class="body">Go ahead</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's like a a job that people look forward to getting</p>
<p class="body">It's it's difficult to get</p>
<p class="body">How come that's not the same thing with teachers like what? </p>
<p class="body">What kind of ******* world do we live in? </p>
<p class="body">Where teachers don't get paid well? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, I'm not saying fire department people shouldn't be paid well</p>
<p class="body">Of course they should be paid well</p>
<p class="body">They should be paid great</p>
<p class="body">It's a ******* very risky job</p>
<p class="body">It's very valuable to the community, but ******* so is teaching</p>
<p class="body">And how is there such a disparity? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">So is teaching and it's crazy that there are so many people who look at K12 teachers and say, like, oh, how come you know how come they get summers off or you know, whatever you know or like don't like that? </p>

<p class="body">Yeah, you know it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's so stupid</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And they don't, you know, and I guess what gets me is when people see someone like a unionized school teacher who has some good benefits</p>
<p class="body">A little bit of job security</p>
<p class="body">Not nearly as good as it should be like</p>
<p class="body">We've been talking about, right, you know, but like, and they say, Oh well, why should they have those things when I don't? </p>
<p class="body">Instead of saying well, how can I get those things right so I could have them? </p>
<p class="body">Do you know, because it doesn't? </p>
<p class="body">You know it doesn't benefit you right? </p>
<p class="body">As an ordinary person if like somebody who has a job like that is paid less</p>
<p class="body">In fact, what it it does is it's bad for your kids if they go to public schools because the kinds of things that teachers unions want</p>
<p class="body">Like smaller class sizes are things that are, you know, like the conditions that they teach in are the same conditions that the kids are are learning in right? </p>
<p class="body">So I think it actually</p>
<p class="body">Benefits everybody like I think that Finland is supposed to have the best public schools in the world by a lot of by a lot of metrics</p>
<p class="body">The best school system you know in the world</p>
<p class="body">They actually don't really have private schools</p>
<p class="body">And in Finland and you know it's very strong unions</p>
<p class="body">You know people are certainly you know</p>
<p class="body">Certainly getting a better deal</p>
<p class="body">Teachers there than they they are here but so many people think the solution is to</p>
<p class="body">You know is to privatize things or you know is is to, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the solution if there's no other options</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if you like if you're a guy right now and you have a child and you have enough money to put them in a really good school that you have to pay for versus a really ****** school that you get for</p>
<p class="body">Free that makes sense</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't blame anybody for making that decision</p>
<p class="body">As an individual, I</p>
<p class="body">Mean like what I would ask? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But they shouldn't have to make that decision</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, exactly</p>
<p class="body">I think what we should have are like excellent public schools so that like everybody can just do that imagine</p>
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Imagine that that's controversial, like literally one of the most important things for the future of our society is raising children correctly and educating them by correctly meaning, like giving, giving them the opportunity to grow and pursue their interests and find out where they fit in life and have enthusiastic well paid teachers, not people that feel like they're being taken advantage of and</p>
<p class="body">Fuct with and just just exhausted all the time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's weird too, because a lot of the same people who are hostile to that will say when they're talking about like corporate CEO's like, oh, you can't complain about how much they're paid because they have to be, you know, like like, you have to have that as an incentive or they're not going to give you their best work if they're not being paid, you know 500 times more</p>
<p class="body">You know, then people who work there, but it's like wait a second so, so why doesn't that logic go for like teachers or other public employees that, like if if they're paid more you know then you're going to get you know then you're going to get a better</p>
<p class="body">Performance out of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Why is it only CEOs? </p>
<p class="body">Well, it's just we have a very distorted set of values when it comes to like what's important and this is again, not saying that</p>
<p class="body">That fire department people are not important</p>
<p class="body">They're ******* hugely important</p>
<p class="body">I respect him very much and I'm glad they get paid well, but I mean they should get the IT</p>
<p class="body">It should be like that with all of what I would think of social services services for the Community that we would gladly pay for for taxes, fixing infrastructures, fixing roads</p>
<p class="body">The problem, I think with a lot of people is they just don't trust government to handle the money</p>

<p class="body">To whom? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, they think that you're going to get a lot of bureaucracy is going to be bloated</p>
<p class="body">There's going to be a **** load of people that are working. They're not gonna resolve it, and it's going to be the sort of that same situation where if you donate to charities and then you find out that like 90% of the money goes to infrastructure and you're in</p>
<p class="body">And you know, just some of those ****** charities where so much money goes to the people that are working there that very little of it goes to the actual charity itself</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Of course, that's</p>
<p class="body">The private sector</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Too, but yes it is, it is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">With everything but I, I guess I would just say one thing about the bureaucracy thing</p>
'cause like I know that that's something that's like a</p>
<p class="body">Easy association lots</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, mine's right. You know that like more government means more bureaucracy, and if you're thinking about people who are like petty gatekeepers, you know we're like gonna be able to approve or deny something. It's like very natural, like resent people like that</p>
<p class="body">But what I would say is that what what situation is actually going to give bureaucrats more power? </p>
<p class="body">Is it going to be if you have something like Medicare for all? </p>
<p class="body">For example, where or, you know, just like how public schools already work, right? </p>
<p class="body">That case for K through 12 that, like every kid, has to be educated</p>
<p class="body">You know, like, like you don't go through a special process</p>
<p class="body">So if it's universal programs, then you don't have what you have with means tested programs where there's somebody who's like looking over your application and deciding whether or not you know you qualify and you know deciding which hoops you have to jump through</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And like that really seems to me like where bureaucrats are really going to get</p>
<p class="body">You know, most of their power, and that's not to say</p>
<p class="body">Like when I was saying that I'm not saying that like there are no legitimate complaints about like any of the agencies that do these things</p>
<p class="body">Of course that are right course, you know</p>
<p class="body">But what I would ask though, is what the what the options are, right? </p>
<p class="body">So 'cause 'cause if you privatize something then you're still? </p>
<p class="body">You know you're still having decisions being made by</p>
<p class="body">You know decision makers, who you know who you don't necessarily</p>
<p class="body">You know like might be very distant from you, but the difference is, at least when it's public</p>
<p class="body">Then you know, theoretically, right? </p>
<p class="body">You can at least elect the people who are</p>
<p class="body">You know who are overseeing it, whereas if something is like subcontracted out to a private corporation</p>
<p class="body">Then like, that's not even true anymore, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like there's another layer in between</p>
<p class="body">You is like an ordinary person and control over this</p>
<p class="body">This institution</p>
<p class="body">I mean like if</p>
<p class="body">You know, if the federal government does anything bad, then we can</p>
<p class="body">You know theoretically, get, you know, get rid of them</p>
<p class="body">Although I think there are a lot of very undemocratic things about America's political system that make it</p>
<p class="body">Way harder to do that, I mean, the fact that we've only got 2 political parties that are basically allowed to participate in all the the fact you</p>
<p class="body">Know like we</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, you go on and on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">We could go on and on, right, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The money that's involved in getting these people elected</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, the money definitely right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Amounts of money from special interest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Groups, yeah, no question right? </p>
<p class="body">So like I think it's I think we've got like, you know, we've got like a little bit of democracy there</p>
<p class="body">Not nearly as much as we should, right? </p>
<p class="body">But like Jeff Bezos isn't up for election by anybody, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like, like, like, he's just there, right? </p>
<p class="body">So like if you have</p>
<p class="body">You know, like if for example you know you you didn't have like the public post office, right it was</p>
<p class="body">It was just like Amazon, you know, taking the you know like Amazon trucks and that's it then</p>
<p class="body">Now you're talking about an institution that that there's no democratic control over, right? </p>
<p class="body">There's some like a little bit of indirect control in the case</p>
<p class="body">Of the the Post office, which you know, by the way, I would point out that like</p>
<p class="body">When conservatives talk about you, know bureaucracy and inefficiency and stuff like that, they always bring that up. But like if you actually look at polls like 90% of Americans like the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Post office the Post office is amazing</p>
<p class="body">They can get a ******* letter across the country less than a dollar</p>
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<p class="body">Crazy is that</p>
<p class="body">Yeah you</p>
<p class="body">Could what does it cost for a stamp? </p>
<p class="body">Let's say that now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's like I know it's less than a dollar it's it's been awhile since I actually yeah, like I think my wife usually like flies this stuff, the post office but like but like, but the fact that you can take a letter from Austin to like rural Alaska for a buck for a buck is ******* bonkers is ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I just email stuff I don't ******* mail **** anymore, but like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And no private company would</p>
<p class="body">Would have the the incentive to do that, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know and and and I think that that's</p>
<p class="body">Like one of the things that Bernie Sanders was talking about, the two times he ran for president, and it's not one of the things that was played up the most</p>
<p class="body">Is postal banking you know which is the idea that you could have like basic basic banking services offered at the post office, which they actually do have in some Scandinavian countries and that was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Basic banking service like deposits and withdrawals and stuff like that at the post</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Office, why would you do that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">At the Post office, which is, which is because it's a public institution that already exists everywhere, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know their their post offices all over the place</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So they would sort out money as well as mail</p>
<p class="body">What if the money goes to the wrong places like the mail sometimes goes? </p>
<p class="body">I get mail from wrong people sometimes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the mail does sometimes go to the wrong places</p>
<p class="body">I would point out if you look at like FedEx, you know FedEx versus the universe is the post office</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Or two wrong people I should say? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know it's it's the the I, I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't actually think the the failure rate you know is is worse with the</p>
<p class="body">With the the USPS, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, we have a problem with UPS</p>
<p class="body">Here we get our ******* packages get stolen</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They just leave him here</p>
<p class="body">And we're not here and someone snatched it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well, I don't know</p>
<p class="body">That's you know if the alternative is they they they put the thing on</p>
<p class="body">The you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, put the ******* thing on the door</p>
<p class="body">Man will come get it</p>
<p class="body">You got a lazy UPS driver, but your subject like at home I got a great guy but it's it's like you're subjected to the whoever the **** it is</p>
<p class="body">It's running that route, you know, unfortunately</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No fair enough, right? </p>
<p class="body">But but what I would just point out is this that like right now there are a lot of people who for one reason or another they can't get a bank account</p>
<p class="body">Like you know that they have that</p>
<p class="body">I mean the most like extreme case might be like somebody who's who's like homeless, you know so they don't have an address</p>
<p class="body">But like even short of that right, there are people who, for one reason or another have trouble getting a bank account</p>
<p class="body">So you have all these, like parasitical, like you know, check cashing you know businesses and stuff like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That, like prey on people like that and I think having some kind of public alternative</p>
<p class="body">Would like go a long way to to helping with that issue</p>
<p class="body">There are countries that already exist, you know so so I think that like in the short term</p>
<p class="body">Like the stuff that makes sense to me is finding ways you know where it makes sense</p>
<p class="body">It might not always make sense, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, but finding ways that you can expand what's not just like you have to find some private corporation to to do it for you, but that can be within the sort of</p>
<p class="body">You know the public, the public sphere, and then look</p>
<p class="body">I mean, there are things that will probably always need</p>
<p class="body">You know private businesses for I'm under no illusions about that. You know that you know, if you don't want to have, like the way grocery stores were in like the Soviet Union in 1985 or whatever, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know you you have to have you know like there are certain things, price signals and you know firm failure</p>
<p class="body">You probably do need to have</p>
<p class="body">But I do think like at the sort of outer edges of what I would like that it would be good if it was a long term goal to move towards having it be more of a norm that that you know workers like own like a lot of a lot of private businesses</p>
<p class="body">You know that there are</p>
<p class="body">You know, if you look at like the Mondragon Corporation in Spain, you know that that that has like 80,000. You know worker members you know who who own that</p>
<p class="body">You know you have like the equivalent, like an operating agreement, which is like the equivalent of a Union contract, but there's no like separate Boston negotiate with</p>
<p class="body">And you</p>
<p class="body">You know might not necessarily directly elect managers, because there could be things that are, like, you know, technical things that you know managers have to do that, like you want that to be more of a traditional job application, but you can at least elect the people who who hire them and</p>
<p class="body">Even if I could, like you know, whatever like a magical genie would, just like somehow</p>
<p class="body">Grant me you</p>
<p class="body">Know that like all of my political preferences where we're satisfied in ways that I don't think they're going to be anytime soon. Given all those problems with America's political system, we talked about earlier</p>
<p class="body">But like even if</p>
<p class="body">That happened, I don't think that like every single business should have to be like that, that if you you know like</p>
<p class="body">Hire a guy to you, know to to do like graphic design for your podcast for 10 hours a week or something that they have to have, like voting rights and cooperative like that would be silly, but I think that you can</p>
<p class="body">I think we could move towards an economy where that was like a much more common thing</p>
<p class="body">And I think that would be way better off because the way it is</p>
<p class="body">In like the kinds of corporations that dominate the economy right now, where you'll get like Amazon workers who are like sometimes like working at the warehouse and then they have to have like a second job at night and their boss literally has enough money off of that to buy his own spaceship, right? </p>
<p class="body">That that strikes me</p>
<p class="body">As a level of of inequality that's really hard to justify by the principles that we kind of</p>
<p class="body">Started with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, what do? </p>
<p class="body">What do they pay at Amazon? </p>
<p class="body">Are they so so? </p>
<p class="body">I think just the underpaid I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't think that they're egregiously underpaid by the standards of the standards</p>
<p class="body">The of, like you know, corporate America as a whole</p>
<p class="body">I think I think it is up to you know</p>
15 Now I'd have to check the exact numbers, but I think that the but like what I would</p>
<p class="body">What I would question is just this though right like</p>
<p class="body">When you're dividing up right, like the revenues that the whole company is making, then you say like there are lots of ways that if you are in a cooperative and people could vote on pay scales, there are lots of things you could do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">To convince somebody like employees vote on</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Pay scales, yeah, like if you have like a worker, cooperative, right, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know then</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But the problem with that is a lot more workers than there are Jeff Bezos</p>
<p class="body">And if they decide to say, like we, we should get most of the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Money OK, but they put but what do you think? </p>
<p class="body">What do you think Jeff Bezos is is doing like what's the? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">What yoke? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's doing coke and he's banging his girlfriend on a yacht</p>
<p class="body">He's living like a guy who's got a</p>
180 
$3 billion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">One space</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, going to space on a rocket ship looks like a</p>
**** he's shooting a giant metal **** up into the heavens</p>
<p class="body">He's literally trying to Fock space</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's what he's doing that he's supposed to do</p>
<p class="body">When you make that kind of money with my fascination with Jeff Bezos is his transformation from nerd to like this like muscle looking guy</p>
<p class="body">It looks like, uh, jujitsu</p>
<p class="body">Black belt</p>
<p class="body">He looks like a tank</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of crazy, and he's now he's got</p>
<p class="body">He used to have this like very respectable normal wife and now he's got this bombshell girlfriend</p>
<p class="body">It's kind of hilarious</p>
<p class="body">I love it</p>
<p class="body">I love a good cliche</p>
<p class="body">I really do</p>
<p class="body">I love the fact they have to take down a bridge because he made a yacht that is so ******* big in order for it to get out of the the place where they're making it, they have to disassemble a ******* bridge</p>
<p class="body">And he's like, yeah, disassembled the bridge</p>

<p class="body">Like **** the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
**** man</p>
<p class="body">Why do you need a yacht so big? </p>
<p class="body">They have to</p>
<p class="body">What are you doing? </p>
<p class="body">What are you doing? </p>
<p class="body">He's just out of control, but that's like I feel like everyone that gets to that level of wealth seems to go out of control</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, no, it it definitely does</p>
<p class="body">It definitely does seem that way</p>
<p class="body">Right and then their their kids</p>
<p class="body">In many cases start out of control because they grew up their entire lives like having this</p>
<p class="body">Like level of wealth</p>
<p class="body">That makes it easy to get anybody to do whatever you want them to do</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's part of the problem</p>
<p class="body">The other part of the problem is there's no time to be with the kids, so when you're working and you're the CEO of Amazon, I mean the ******* hours that guy was putting in is probably insane</p>
<p class="body">He's probably working when he was working</p>
<p class="body">He's not CEO anymore, but he's probably working 16 hours a</p>
<p class="body">Day, how the **** 
<p class="body">Can you instill some sort of sense of normalcy in your children? </p>
<p class="body">When you're never home, it's not really possible</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's and</p>
<p class="body">So then you compensate with gifts and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And and and now he's pictures</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, now he's too busy, you know, storming coke and you know, going into</p>
<p class="body">Space all that stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And and banging his bombshell girlfriend woo? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah I I feel what you're saying</p>
<p class="body">Do you think that? </p>
<p class="body">Do you have hope for? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, there seems such a polarization in this country</p>
<p class="body">There's people that are completely disagree with on the right that are like pull yourself up by your bootstraps</p>
<p class="body">All that stuff like that that is nonsense talk when people talk like that</p>
<p class="body">I'm like Jesus Christ man</p>
<p class="body">Not everybody is starting from the same position, it's it's a crazy disparity</p>
<p class="body">And until we address that</p>
<p class="body">As a society, until we look at these impoverished communities that have been impoverished for decades and decades and decades, and you know, if you really want to talk about where my real feelings of socialism lie, my feelings of socialism are there are communities, and it's not just inner cities, it's like Appalachia, it's these coal mining towns like we have to dump money into these places and help these folks</p>
<p class="body">Because if you don't, you're gonna have people that come out of there and they're gonna cost you exponentially more money and all the problems that they create in their own lives</p>
<p class="body">And other people's lives with whether it's crime or whether it's drug addiction or whether it's whatever despair that comes out of these horrific starting points that these people are from. That can be fixed</p>
<p class="body">And this is like where I'm a bleeding heart</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And yeah, I mean they can be fixed, but like it it sure</p>
<p class="body">Hasn't been</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It hasn't been even addressed, no even addressed they</p>
<p class="body">There's no talk whatsoever about looking at communities like Baltimore and saying, hey, this has been ****** from the beginning</p>
<p class="body">Like what do we do? </p>
<p class="body">Like, look at the red line laws</p>
<p class="body">They instituted</p>
<p class="body">Look at the fact that</p>
<p class="body">The same</p>
<p class="body">What was his name Woods? </p>
<p class="body">What was the the cop that we had on? </p>
<p class="body">Michael Woods he was on he was a police officer in Baltimore</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and he was working there and one of the things that he noticed was they found a rap like a, you know, a arrest sheet from like the 1970s and it showed all of the same</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Exact crimes that they're dealing with in the current time, all in the same areas, and they were all happening this in like the same thing was going on all the different arrests for violence and drugs and all this different stuff and he was like Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="body">This is not like and he felt this feeling like</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm in a system that's broken like you're not gonna fix this like you're just gonna keep arresting people and you you keep having this</p>
<p class="body">You know the systemic equality inequality in this area, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Just been ****** from for decades</p>
<p class="body">Yeah no</p>
<p class="body">I mean I think that 'cause by the time you're dealing with that on that level you're you're treating symptoms</p>
<p class="body">You know that they like it's, it's already</p>
<p class="body">The problem has has already happened</p>
<p class="body">And you know, don't get me wrong, I know people commit crimes for all kinds of reasons</p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying it's all economic, but like</p>
<p class="body">Also, I don't see a lot of like kids in the suburbs joining gangs right? </p>
<p class="body">Like there</p>
<p class="body">There is a reason there is a reason</p>
<p class="body">That right, you know, the things that like really drive up the violent crime rate you know are things that have a lot to do with poverty and inequality</p>
<p class="body">And I think that if you you know you talked about Appalachia, I mean like the Obama administration's like response to like all the coal, you know, like this sort of misery caused by all the coal mines closing was to, you know, just kind of sprinkle the region with</p>

<p class="body">Well, if 
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I forgot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You learn to code ******** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, that's exactly it, right? </p>
'cause like they they put up these technology training centers, so it's essentially telling people to learn to code</p>
'cause like yeah, if you're like a 50 year old laid off coal miner, you'll definitely get the coding job and preference over the 22 year old kid. You know who just who just graduated. It's it's absurd and and then, like Trump, came in</p>
<p class="body">But he said he was going to bring the jobs back and there are fewer jobs there than, you know, than ever, right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, I, I don't think that I don't think any of these people</p>
<p class="body">Are are serious about helping working class people either in places like Baltimore or in places like Appalachia because you know, I think they I think the Democrats, increasingly the kind of liberalism that's dominant in the Democratic Party right now</p>
<p class="body">I think isn't really about that</p>
<p class="body">I think that what it's really about is trying to have like a more diverse ruling class like</p>
<p class="body">I know that sounds like an oversimplification, but I really think a lot of it's just about that right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that</p>
<p class="body">Like what they like, to the extent they're concerned with social justice, what they're concerned about is disparity</p>
<p class="body">You know that you have</p>
<p class="body">More black people than white people</p>
<p class="body">Who are, you know, living in poverty and going through a criminal justice system and all this stuff</p>
<p class="body">And that's absolutely true, right? </p>
<p class="body">That that is</p>
<p class="body">And that is completely a result of the fact that</p>
<p class="body">You know, up until the 1960s, we literally lived in an empire tide country. You know that in much of the United States you know there, you know we had</p>
<p class="body">Jim Crow laws</p>
<p class="body">You know on the on the books you know, and and there I think there's I think the horrible racial history of the United States is</p>
<p class="body">The reason for that? </p>
<p class="body">But what's the goal right is the goal is what you count as justice? </p>
<p class="body">Having like, exactly demographically correct, proportions of every group living in poverty? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well also this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And it's you know, being like</p>
<p class="body">All of that stuff like it's ridiculous</p>
<p class="body">I was just going to say like the Republicans are</p>
<p class="body">Even worse, right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean like Republicans, when they claim that they're like big populist</p>
<p class="body">Now it's like, well, what do you actually want to do? </p>
<p class="body">Do you want when they care for all do? </p>
<p class="body">You want you know, like they don't support any of that stuff</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's also their positions or weaponized, you know, and it's there</p>
<p class="body">There's so much polar that I think it's very unhealthy to have two positions</p>
<p class="body">A red position of blue position because people are so malleable</p>
<p class="body">They're so easily manipulated and they want to be a part of a tribe, and they'll just subscribe to these ideas and then they they take comfort in the fact there's other people that agree with them so they get in these Facebook groups and they they just like you know, talk about stuff that everyone else in their little echo chamber agrees with and and they feel like the whole world should bend to their will</p>
<p class="body">And it's just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's a bizarre time, absolutely, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That I mean we</p>
<p class="body">You know what we were talking about? </p>
<p class="body">Earlier about the fact that the collapse of traditional media means that everybody gets to curate, you know their</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Own little media that's a problem too, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Mediafire right</p>
<p class="body">You know that you can</p>
<p class="body">It's so easy now to just like, expose yourself to absolutely nothing all the time except people who agree with you</p>
<p class="body">Because yeah, if there are only a couple million people watching like one of the you know traditional networks at any given night</p>
<p class="body">Then you know what's their profit incentive</p>
<p class="body">Their profit incentive is to like relentlessly pander to whatever audience they have</p>
<p class="body">They have left, so if you know if you're fox</p>
<p class="body">You know you you scare old, you know conservatives and you know, whatever like the MSNBC has their own version like we're talking about</p>
<p class="body">But I think that like This is why I try to like go out and do debates all the time, because which like some people in this one of the things I talk about in the book, right? </p>
<p class="body">Some people on the left don't like that, right? </p>
<p class="body">They say that like if you're</p>
<p class="body">You know, if you're like if you talk to a bad person basically right, you know they'll say, like, oh your platform, and you know that that person that's so stupid</p>
<p class="body">Is a word I hate so much, but they have but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Get that more than anybody because I I you know people want to say that I'm like a fake liberal because I talked to conservatives and I'm friends with some conservatives like that is the dumbest ******* thing to ever you</p>
<p class="body">We need to communicate with each other</p>
<p class="body">We're supposed to be in a community</p>
<p class="body">The community is the human race first of all, and then the United States 2nd</p>
<p class="body">It's supposed to be a community, and if there I have a lot of friends that have completely different perspectives that than me they have a lot of friends that are like very Christian</p>
<p class="body">I have friends that are very Muslim</p>
<p class="body">I have friends that have, you know, no religious affiliation whatsoever</p>
<p class="body">I have friends that are right wing and left wing and I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't mind</p>
<p class="body">All those things, as long as you're not a suppressive person, you're not suppressing people that have an opposite position or an opposite perspective, like, why not? </p>
<p class="body">What are we doing here? </p>
<p class="body">Aren't we just talking to each other? </p>
<p class="body">It shouldn't? </p>
<p class="body">We like communicate with people that are</p>
<p class="body">But when I have people on you know you'll, I'll get all this pushback like or someone like Ben Shapiro</p>
<p class="body">Ben Shapiro is</p>
<p class="body">A lovely guy meet him, get to know him</p>
<p class="body">He's very nice</p>
<p class="body">I don't agree with him a lot</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, a lot on a lot of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Stuff, yeah, I mean, look if if</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I love the guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Sure, I mean look if if you know Ben Shapiro ever wanted to like come on my show and argue with me, I would. I would 100% do that</p>

<p class="body">I bet he'd do it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">But I think it's OK</p>
<p class="body">Well, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But he talks really fast</p>
<p class="body">You gotta be careful 'cause it's hard</p>
<p class="body">To keep</p>
<p class="body">Up with him, it's like his ******* brain is on a different RPM</p>
<p class="body">You gotta whenever I talk to him I try to slow things down</p>
<p class="body">Slow down youngster</p>
<p class="body">That's awesome, but he's very enthusiastic</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't agree with him on a lot of things, particularly on gay issues</p>
<p class="body">He thinks that gay folks shouldn't just</p>
<p class="body">They should just not do it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Which is which is ridiculous, like you're gonna</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's it's this</p>

<p class="body">It's the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Strangest position, I just don't understand that position</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">So so like you, if you're gay, you have like a moral obligation to just be celibate for your entire life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, you're supposed to actually engage in heterosexual sex</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, what's but what's amazing is that this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">OK</p>
<p class="body">That's that. Sounds like it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, this is where that falls apart, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because this is all based on ancient writing like who? </p>
<p class="body">Because God said this like who said God said this? </p>
<p class="body">Who are these ******* people and what else did they say God said? </p>
<p class="body">Did they say anything about zombies? </p>
<p class="body">They say anything about people coming back from the dead, like what did God say? </p>
<p class="body">Did I mean how much did they say? </p>
<p class="body">That doesn't make sense? </p>
<p class="body">Did they say anything about partying oceans and like did did anybody like lead someone to a place and part SC? </p>
'cause that doesn't seem real</p>
<p class="body">Maybe someone was lying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, right, that's that's</p>
<p class="body">That's that's like, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, anybody who does anybody who knows gay people right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I have gay friends that are like you could never tell they're gay 'cause they don't</p>
<p class="body">You know, they just seem</p>
<p class="body">Like a man and then I have gay friends who like Oh no straight guy acts like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, they're</p>
<p class="body">Gay from space, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yes, it's super gay</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That's yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Like when you meet a super gay person, that first of all they enjoy behaving that way</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Sure, sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That is how they like to talk. That's how they like. Like Justin martindale's. Great example my friend Justin</p>
<p class="body">He's gay as **** but he's hilarious</p>
<p class="body">I mean, he's hilarious with it</p>
<p class="body">He's like he's a joyful gay person</p>
<p class="body">You wouldn't get confused when you're around him</p>
<p class="body">You wouldn't say</p>
<p class="body">What do you think this guy is? </p>
<p class="body">Like that guy is</p>
<p class="body">Gay, you know</p>
<p class="body">But like that's how he is, man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that that's how he is and the idea is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This idea that this is he's he's supposed to make a choice to have sex with women like **** 
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's that</p>
<p class="body">Sounds like a good deal for the woman to Jesus, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That woman he's closing his eyes thinking about beards and **** 
<p class="body">It's so dumb</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and and I think and also I mean we could talk to about like</p>
<p class="body">OK, so there's the part in the Red Sea stuff</p>
<p class="body">There's also the like slavery in the Bible, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like that's you know, like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh God, a ton of it, you know, and and then treating women as second class citizens condoning slavery</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of murder in the in the Bible for disrespecting people</p>
<p class="body">Like how about that? </p>
<p class="body">The the one guy when the kids called him bald and they seek the ******* bear to kill all the kids? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, the she bears</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Then kids</p>
<p class="body">They killed the bear</p>
<p class="body">They killed, the bears, killed the kids 'cause they called him a bald guy like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Because they called him old bald head</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What the **** coming from a bald person? </p>
<p class="body">Let me tell you something, that's an overreach</p>
<p class="body">That's ridiculous, but it's this idea that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You don't you? </p>
<p class="body">You don't think if like some kids tasty about that</p>
<p class="body">They deserve the</p>
<p class="body">Death penalty</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Listen, I think there's some things that are fascinating about religious traditions that I think they can act as a scaffolding for moral behavior, and some of the like the kindest, nicest people I know are Christians, and I think that there's</p>
<p class="body">Something about that sort of structure that that religious structure</p>
<p class="body">When I was younger I was much more of a what you would say like a traditional, like agnostic or atheist, like I thought it was dumb</p>
<p class="body">I thought the religion was dumb</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it's dumb anymore and I think it's greatly beneficial to some people and I think it does give them a structure</p>
<p class="body">And if you Jordan Peterson said something that really made a lot of sense</p>
<p class="body">He said</p>
<p class="body">It's not whether or not I believe in God, he goes</p>
<p class="body">But if you live your life like God exists, you will have a higher quality of life</p>
<p class="body">And is that if you live your life like you are a part of this</p>
<p class="body">Enormous community of loving beings that are all connected to this higher power and that you have this like moral obligation to be a good person, and that there's great value and benefit in that</p>
<p class="body">And then there's there's a spiritual path to take of a righteous person who's really trying to do good in this world</p>
<p class="body">And I think for a lot of people, religion can act as a scaffolding to substantiate and enforce those kind of positive traits and positive</p>
<p class="body">Paths of life, and I think there's great benefit in that</p>
<p class="body">I think it's there's great</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Good in that, yeah, I mean look, I'm an atheist but you know, but I have tremendous respect for</p>
<p class="body">Christians who get what you just described out of it I I have to say there are Christians who get very different things out of it, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that they that they want to like</p>
<p class="body">You know, ban abortion and make gay people go back in the closet and all that stuff you know</p>
<p class="body">But like but look, I mean I, I think like Cornell West, you know I, I think that's a that's a Christian</p>
<p class="body">I have immense respect for us</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's have you ever met? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Him no, no I I have</p>
<p class="body">He was on like so I I used to do a segment on the Michael Brooks Show and I think he was on that at</p>
<p class="body">Least at least once</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I miss that guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I'm a couple times</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, he was great</p>
<p class="body">Yeah he was he was, he was</p>
<p class="body">He was one of my my closest friends for the last couple of years before he before he passed</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's a funny dude too man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That was just</p>
<p class="body">He was a very so</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He was funny</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Very funny guy</p>
<p class="body">What he would do like the the like Nation of Islam, Obama and you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Good impressions</p>
<p class="body">He was just a really thoughtful, interesting guy who knew a **** load about politics</p>
<p class="body">And you know, and about socialism and he was a really good guy to sort of defend these positions of democratic socialism too</p>
'cause he didn't seem like a bad person, you know, like when, and even in critiquing other people</p>
<p class="body">That this this disagreed with him</p>
<p class="body">I felt like he did it for the most</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Part pretty reasonably, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Well, I think that one thing that he really got, and I actually think he helped me to get</p>
<p class="body">You know, since in the you know in the years since I met him is that</p>
<p class="body">Like a lot of people who who agree with with his position with my position don't</p>
<p class="body">Think nearly enough about what's going to be appealing to</p>
<p class="body">Like most ordinary people, right? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know that they have 'cause like if you're just</p>
<p class="body">You know, like which is one of the reasons I wrote the book that like that stuff was starting to drive me crazy</p>
<p class="body">You know that like it seems like what a lot of people want to do is be part of an in Group and like yell at everybody who who doesn't</p>
<p class="body">You know who isn't like already on board with like every single thing on on a checklist and and that's just not going to</p>
<p class="body">That's just not gonna work, right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, that's like like if you actually care about this stuff, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you think, yeah, I</p>
<p class="body">I think that we have like a grotesquely unequal society</p>
<p class="body">I think that you know</p>
<p class="body">I think we need to have National Health care</p>
<p class="body">We need to, you know, not fight all these wars around the world</p>
<p class="body">All of that stuff and like you're actually talking about this stuff</p>
'cause you care about it</p>
<p class="body">Which, let's be honest, not everybody does</p>
<p class="body">I mean some people</p>
<p class="body">Politics is like a weird hobby for them, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">But like if you really care about that stuff</p>
<p class="body">Then you want to present that in a way that's going to appeal to ordinary people who haven't read everything that you've read, who who aren't like, necessarily don't have all the same like subculture you know sensibilities that</p>
<p class="body">That you have so like yeah, I mean it drives me</p>
<p class="body">It drives me crazy when I see people who who want all the things that</p>
<p class="body">You know all the things that I want who are instead of trying to, you know, find ways that they can explain this to people who might like you, know, agree with them on some things, disagree with them on some things, like a lot of people, like most people aren't like centrists in the way that the media means when they say centrist right, which is like the you know whatever</p>
<p class="body">Socially liberal, fiscally conservative</p>
<p class="body">All that stuff, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">Like like most people</p>
<p class="body">I think just have weird combinations of views right, which is because</p>
<p class="body">Like if you spend all of your time thinking about politics and tweeting about politics and all of that stuff, you're like kind of an unusual person</p>
<p class="body">Most people don't do that</p>
<p class="body">They have other things that they have to do, so they might have political reactions to things they have political impulses</p>
<p class="body">But like, they haven't necessarily thought through every single thing you know to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They probably don't have the time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that of course they don't have the time</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">If you want to get involved deeply into the weeds and politics, you're gonna it's tremendous amount of hours for years and years and years just to get a base understanding of what's going on</p>
<p class="body">That's why it's so impressive when you talk to someone who really does know a lot about politics</p>
<p class="body">Like whenever I talk to like my friend Kyle Kulinski never talked to him about politics like</p>
<p class="body">That ************ knows a lot like so when we had the end of the World Podcast when there was the election this past year when we brought him, I I brought him out like you're the voice of reason</p>
<p class="body">Like you actually understand what's going on here, and he called it every step of the way</p>
<p class="body">You see all these people that had like these conspiracy theories about? </p>
<p class="body">Trump, like oh the mail in votes</p>
<p class="body">He explained he's like the mail in votes are going to be majority Democrat votes</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and he goes</p>
<p class="body">So if you look at Trump getting way ahead in places like Pennsylvania and there's a couple of these other states he's like, this is what's going on</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of the Republican folks are going to show up, and they're going to vote in person and then the mail in is going to be overwhelmingly democratic</p>
<p class="body">And then he's probably going to lose a lot of numbers overnight and</p>
<p class="body">They're like, oh, he went</p>
<p class="body">We went to bed and he was ahead</p>
<p class="body">But then it's like Kyle Kolinsky explained it, explained it all on the podcast, clearly called it just caught, and that's because</p>
<p class="body">That's a guy who's been like really studying politics at a like very comprehensive level for a long time, and he can give you the like</p>
<p class="body">The real information about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">It yeah and most people like I said they they don't have the time</p>
<p class="body">I mean especially when you're in a increasingly precarious economy where lots of people</p>
<p class="body">Like might have a couple of jobs and like drive an Uber on the side, you know like just just 'cause they're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How to **** Do you have time? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Trying to 
<p class="body">Yeah, of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Unless you're just listening to podcasts all the time and you know like really educational podcasts on on on politics like</p>
<p class="body">And even then, you're going to get a cursory sort of understanding of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">It yeah, absolutely so</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I think that what you know what you should really be? </p>
<p class="body">Would you approach people to try to convince them of the things that are? </p>
<p class="body">That are important to you</p>
<p class="body">Like you shouldn't start from a place of do you? </p>
<p class="body">You know, do you have all the like, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, to, uh, you have all the right positions</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And like all of this stuff, because you know, by definition, look if everybody you know</p>
<p class="body">If everybody agreed with me about all this stuff, we'd be living in a very different country right now, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like like so, so I think that</p>
<p class="body">You need to assume the real question like is does somebody have like? </p>
<p class="body">Values that are just like totally incompatible with mine and or do they just have like? </p>
<p class="body">Economic interests that are going to like lead them to like they're never going to agree with me, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like like, like Jeff Bezos</p>
<p class="body">And I are never going to agree on like what? </p>
<p class="body">Tax rates should be for obvious reasons, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Would like you to talk to him though I think that'll be an interesting conversation</p>
<p class="body">I don't</p>
<p class="body">I've never heard him discuss money in terms of like wealth and taxes and things like</p>
<p class="body">I wonder what his position is on that</p>
<p class="body">I feel like there's a system that's in place that you would almost be</p>
<p class="body">Negligent if you didn't take advantage of it</p>
<p class="body">You know, if if you're a guy who's making a lot of</p>
<p class="body">Money and this is</p>
<p class="body">This is how you could pay X amount of taxes</p>
<p class="body">And this is like these are your deductions, and this is like the law</p>
<p class="body">You follow the law tuiti and then the rest of it</p>
<p class="body">You can give out charitably, if you choose to</p>
<p class="body">But like, I wonder what? </p>
<p class="body">His position is on all that stuff, like when you've got that kind of money</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean, I think that my suspicion is that it starts to look very different, right you</p>
<p class="body">Know once you get all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That cash 
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah right, you know like you're going to, you know like you're going to feel very</p>
<p class="body">It's really hard to convince somebody that like who's benefiting that much from the</p>
<p class="body">Way things are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now do you see the image of him at the New Year's party with his girlfriend? </p>
<p class="body">No, Jamie help me out. This is so important because someone needs to superimpose this with, uh, an image of Jeff Bezos from like, 1989</p>
<p class="body">Like what he looked</p>
<p class="body">Like when he started Amazon versus what he looks like now</p>
<p class="body">I mean when did he start? </p>
<p class="body">Amazon must be in the 90s</p>
<p class="body">Right because? </p>
<p class="body">It was an online book look thing, yeah and he was like this kind</p>
<p class="body">Of nerdy guy</p>
<p class="body">Now look at him and look at his girlfriend</p>
<p class="body">I mean this is amazing</p>
<p class="body">Like he's got ******* heart and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">The heart sunglasses</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">In his defense, in his defense, this was actually a party that was, for it was like a disco themed party</p>
<p class="body">So you're supposed to dress like this, so everybody dressed like that</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They all dress silly</p>
<p class="body">It was just</p>
<p class="body">It was a fun party</p>
<p class="body">So he had these glasses that were like heart shaped lenses and he's got this bombshell girlfriend who's leaning on him</p>
<p class="body">I love it</p>
<p class="body">I love excess</p>
<p class="body">I love when people are preposterous</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, that's why I love it</p>

<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah no, no</p>
<p class="body">I mean fair enough like</p>
<p class="body">And again, I don't blame it</p>
<p class="body">Like if you're not like</p>
<p class="body">You know doing some things that I do think you know Bezos has done</p>
<p class="body">But like, you know</p>
<p class="body">But if you know, but there are like a list you know, like if you're not like busting unions and this and that, right? </p>
<p class="body">Then like look</p>
<p class="body">If you look at that, just look at</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How it started? </p>
<p class="body">I wasn't going</p>
<p class="body">They did it</p>
<p class="body">Someone did it</p>

<p class="body">Ha ha ha</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Look at that</p>
<p class="body">That's ******* amazing</p>
<p class="body">That's amazing</p>
<p class="body">Work hard folks, and you don't have to be a dork</p>
<p class="body">Imagine shave your head, get a bombshell girlfriend</p>
<p class="body">Ooh I love it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Happy days are here, let's go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Hundreds of millions of dollars help</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Let's guys live different lives</p>
<p class="body">He's lived billions of dollars, hundreds of billions, not hundreds of 1,000,000 Sir hundreds of billions</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That's outrageous, yeah, now I mean is on track to be the first trillionaire, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's that's what? </p>
<p class="body">They're saying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh, there's trillionaires out</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">There yeah, OK, are there? </p>
<p class="body">I thought they were saying like in 2020 they were saying that like</p>
<p class="body">At the end of the OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, the trillionaires are all non public</p>
<p class="body">See if you think about like the royal families like they they don't have to disclose their wealth</p>
<p class="body">These people that have literally they own countries</p>
<p class="body">I mean if you think I mean we don't have to name the countries but there I know for a fact 'cause I have talked to people who are in fact billionaires</p>
<p class="body">We're very wealthy business people that laugh and they've told me the royal families and some of these countries are worth trillions of dollars and they don't have to disclose it</p>
<p class="body">So when you get this public list of who the richest people in the world are, that's the richest people publicly</p>
<p class="body">That you know, like they have to disclose it</p>
<p class="body">They're not oligarchs, they're not people that are in charge, literally in charge of the oil</p>
<p class="body">All the oil in a particular part of the world where billions of dollars are coming out every day</p>
<p class="body">Like come on, there's a **** load of money involved in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That yeah, and I mean The thing is, even if you're not like one of those people, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like you know the the non you know non public trillionaires you know from those countries that you're talking about</p>
<p class="body">Like one thing that I think people often don't think about enough when they think about stuff like this is OK</p>
<p class="body">If you have a system where you're going to get like wealth gaps, that extreme right, you know that you can</p>
<p class="body">You can have people who are trillionaires maybe or who at least have hundreds of billions of dollars</p>
<p class="body">Then you're just not going to have political democracy</p>
<p class="body">The way that we should have it because you know the idea that like everybody is going to have the same amount of influence on the government is just ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">It's ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, once you get to that level, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because like if you</p>
<p class="body">Work at an Amazon warehouse and you want to like call your congressman</p>
<p class="body">You'll be lucky if you have a conversation with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">An intern, but Jeff Bezos can make a phone call to Biden</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah no absolutely Biden would take the call</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Anybody like hey ************ 
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Because if he told him, right, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Listen bro, take a couple extra Advil and let's have a conversation</p>
<p class="body">I need to be awake for this one</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, which which you might have to</p>
<p class="body">Provide him but yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What what happened to the left, where somewhere along the line this get back to your book on the subject that we started with? </p>

<p class="body">Good good Yep</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What happened to the left, where they are willing to</p>
<p class="body">They there's something that happened where they became</p>
<p class="body">The the side that accepts censorship and even promotes it</p>
<p class="body">And my</p>
<p class="body">My thought is that something morphed during the time where social media became</p>
<p class="body">It became a tool of a lot of right wing people and this is actually like</p>
<p class="body">Pre Trump but was certainly accentuated during the Trump administration</p>
<p class="body">It's like people had a chance to anonymously say things through social media that maybe they wouldn't say around the office because like say if you have like 10 people in your office and nine of them are Democrats and you're a Republican, you really have to keep your mouth shut</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, but when you get on Twitter, you can talk all kinds of crazy **** or read it or whatever, and then all the other people that agree with you</p>
<p class="body">They they get attracted to you and then you form these echo chambers and then some of them are very aggressive in sort of pushing these ideas out and</p>
<p class="body">We saw that a lot with like Milo Yiannopoulos and there was a lot of like these like very influential online right wing people that were</p>
<p class="body">You know they had like cheers from the fans and they had like these throngs of supporters and they silenced those guys</p>
<p class="body">They pulled those guys off social media and they found out that it was effective to do that and then it became a thing that they got really into where they're into silencing, dissenting opinions and it's gone so far that they're doing it to left wing people</p>
<p class="body">That step even remotely outside the bounds of the orthodoxy remotely outside the bounds of what they consider to be the rigid</p>
<p class="body">This the rigid maintaining of this ideology</p>
<p class="body">They step outside of that</p>
<p class="body">They they silence people and they're pulling videos down left and right off of Instagram and Tik T.O.K</p>
<p class="body">And and and Twitter</p>
<p class="body">In some ways, Twitter is like less censorship oriented, even though people think of Twitter as being like a very censored place, it's one of the more lenient</p>
<p class="body">Online platforms, but what the **** happened? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean the Milo case is interesting actually, because I think that I mean, I understand that like he got kicked off of Twitter and that was definitely part of it</p>
<p class="body">But like he was still riding pretty high after that happened like I think that in my Lowe's case and this is what you know when I kind of try to tell people</p>
<p class="body">That, like the ways that like some people on the left like want to like deal with figures like this like forget morality for a second</p>
<p class="body">They're just not going to work right? </p>
<p class="body">So like, here's what I mean by that, right? </p>
<p class="body">That like</p>
<p class="body">Milo's career was built on people trying to like, you know, stop him and Heckle him, and you know stop him from speaking and all that stuff</p>
<p class="body">You know that, like my view on that guy, is that honestly you know he he wouldn't be that interesting if he just showed up on a college campus and like just talked and nobody, you know nobody had erupted him, but like that was why? </p>
<p class="body">Like 'cause he's like, oh, he's like speaking edgy forbidden truths</p>
<p class="body">And like you know it was the dangerous ideas to her</p>
<p class="body">That's what it's called like</p>
<p class="body">I think where Milo really got dropped like like where Milo like was really ended, right? </p>
<p class="body">And I'm not saying there aren't other cases, they're more like what you're talking about, but it seems to me that we're Milo was really ended was when the right dropped him after the age of consent</p>
<p class="body">Stuff like he</p>
<p class="body">He was going to speak at CPAC and they cancelled that he had his book deal, you know, got dropped</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it wasn't just the right dropping</p>
<p class="body">Him, I mean that was across the board people dropped</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Him well, I</p>
<p class="body">I mean, everybody else had always hated him, right? </p>
<p class="body">But then like after that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Happened, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that that was just a thing where it it felt like it was so unacceptable to so many people that it was</p>
<p class="body">It's very rare that one idea</p>
<p class="body">Becomes a thing that completely stops all the momentum that someone had like</p>
<p class="body">He was a very popular cultural figure and then he vanished like his essentially been not just deep platform, but removed from the cultural conversation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean like a week before that happened he was on Bill Maher, right, you? </p>
<p class="body">Know that's that's so, yeah, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, then wild and Bill Maher was praising him and comparing him to Christopher Hitchens</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">He was Christopher Hitchens, which which I do not think Miley Innopolis deserves</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's wild</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">But they</p>
<p class="body">But yeah, look, I think that</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I think that there are a couple things going on there with the the with</p>
<p class="body">With censorship I mean I would push back a little on</p>
<p class="body">On the idea</p>
<p class="body">You know that the that the right isn't like plenty pro censorship in lots of ways</p>
<p class="body">Like like I think</p>
<p class="body">I think they are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I wouldn't say that I, I think, listen, no, I I think that people politically like to silence their opposing or their opposition when someone opposes their position</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, well so we disagree on</p>
<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I think they</p>
<p class="body">Like to do that, but I think is like the left is traditionally been the ACLU, which those Jewish lawyers supported</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The idea of Nazis</p>
<p class="body">Being allowed to say whatever they want because they said that this the counter to that the opposite of that is the suppressing speech, and it's a terrible dangerous road to go down</p>
<p class="body">And the answer to bad ideas is not silencing those ideas, it's better ideas</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">But they were absolutely right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's my position, and that's an old school liberal position, but that doesn't exist that much in the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Now this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Left wing of today</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean that's 100% my position I. I think that and and and I think that it's really dangerous that a lot of people like, even though most of the stuff you're talking about is driven more by like mainstream liberals</p>
<p class="body">That, like it's not like you know whatever you know, people running like these insanely profitable social media companies, right? </p>
<p class="body">It's not like they want all the stuff I want, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, but like but but I I, I see way too many people on the left going along with it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And I think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's super short sighted, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because like how did it happen though? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think it happened by what I'm saying that like they found it was effective for silencing people they felt was problematic</p>
<p class="body">So they just adopted these ideas and then they sort of shifted their their their ethics</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I think there's some of that. I think that I think that a lot of it is that a lot of people feel powerless to change the world in any way that actually matters, and so they end up getting sucked into these like culture, war, distractions about who said what in 1995 that we can like get mad at them about. And you know what, the? </p>
<p class="body">You know, whatever like, just just whatever like weird nonsense people are arguing about this week, right? </p>
<p class="body">The Green Eminem, you know and and like some of this stuff is part of that, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like they have a</p>
<p class="body">That like if you don't like if you can't actually, you know change the world like create a more equal society or whatever you can at least get somebody fired</p>
<p class="body">You can at least get somebody kicked off and then you felt like you've won something, and I think that that's like I think it's incredibly dangerous because like people who want, for example</p>
<p class="body">You know Spotify to to kick you off, you know there there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a move on, you know petition, you know for them to do that that like</p>
<p class="body">What I always say is, even though and the thing that really gets me about the calls for censorship is OK, I think there are principled reasons that you know free speech is important and we should have like open</p>
<p class="body">You know, open debates about controversial ideas</p>
<p class="body">I think there are ways that we have a better society if we do that, but also</p>
<p class="body">I think it's it's crazy that anybody who basically agrees with me about politics would support</p>
<p class="body">Increased corporate censorship, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because if you have like some like social media company, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that's that's going to be owned</p>
<p class="body">You know, like they're going to have, you know, some CEO who's partying like Bezos in that you know in that picture you know, like is, are they? </p>
<p class="body">You know whose side are they going to take with their future things where people say that something is misinformation, you know that they you know 'cause like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right exactly exactly and by what definition is it misinforming? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Information because the problem is</p>
<p class="body">Is that every every political argument is to some extent an argument about facts, right? Like that? Like in 2002, even though my position was, you know, as like a college like anti war activist. Was that even if Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction and still be against the war? 'cause you know, I think the rationale still wouldn't made sense to me</p>
<p class="body">But like that was like part of what people were arguing about was whether there's mass destruction weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">And look if you had had social media companies in 2002 in the way that you do now</p>
<p class="body">And they had misinformation policies. Who would be more likely to get bounds for misinformation? People who said who agreed with the, you know, the government agreed with the New York Times said there were WMD's or people who thought that, like Bush administration, officials were conspiring to lie to the public</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, like and</p>
<p class="body">I think that who's going to like if there's something that comes out tomorrow about like some horrible labor practice at Amazon</p>
<p class="body">Who are these companies more likely to side with, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, people who say, yeah, they did this thing right, or or the the company saying no, it's it's</p>
<p class="body">It's a lie</p>
<p class="body">It's misinformation and</p>
<p class="body">I, I think the the issue with free speech is always</p>
<p class="body">Who gets to decide right like and I think this is the same reason</p>
<p class="body">I mean look, this is the same reason I don't like</p>
<p class="body">You know, I don't like the I don't like the CRT laws either, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because I I don't like the idea that there are going to be people who are second guessing</p>
<p class="body">You know what happened in some, you know some classroom to say like was this too close to like you know to to to one of these ideas that we don't like, right? </p>
<p class="body">Did you talk to your students about something that like flew a little bit too close to the sun? </p>
<p class="body">Of CRT, and that that makes me nervous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">By CRT, you're talking</p>
<p class="body">About critical race theory, just some people</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, sorry critical yeah sorry</p>
<p class="body">Critical race theory, yeah, and I think that like actual critical race theory, their parts</p>
<p class="body">I agree with their parts that I disagree with, but</p>
<p class="body">I don't wanna live in a system</p>
<p class="body">I want to live in the kind of society where when there's salt like some controversial idea that's out there, you know, like that like people can talk about it and debate about it</p>
<p class="body">And like if you can, you know like you could discuss it with students in a classroom like I think</p>
<p class="body">Ideally, the way that education should work</p>
<p class="body">It should foster critical thinking like instead of like</p>
<p class="body">This is exactly what you should think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">For sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know you should be encouraging students to like</p>
<p class="body">You know to think about it, you know more clearly and to argue about it and to you know and to decide</p>
<p class="body">And to decide what they think, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, because like ultimately, if you</p>
<p class="body">Want people to be citizens in a democracy right to the extent that we have one of those like that's that's what you want</p>
<p class="body">Like that's that's how you want them to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Grow up, I hope, yeah, absolutely you want discussion</p>
<p class="body">This way you sort out if you're an observer</p>
<p class="body">The way you sort out who has the better argument is to watch them discuss you</p>
<p class="body">Remember the gore Vidal</p>
<p class="body">And we've got Buckley speeches, you know, which is a great documentary</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">William F yes</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What is it called best of enemies? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Best of enemies</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a fantastic documentary where it shows that</p>
<p class="body">I mean, this is the difference in our culture today versus then these guys I believe is on ABC</p>
<p class="body">These guys had this like really highly rated debate series</p>
<p class="body">I think they did like</p>
<p class="body">How many of them they do, six of them or something? </p>
<p class="body">Like that I don't remember how</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Many, but they did a few</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, they did quite a few so they were going back and forth</p>
<p class="body">And William F</p>
<p class="body">Buckley was a famous conservative</p>
<p class="body">Gore Vidal was a famous liberal and they had these fascinating discussions and they did them on national television</p>
<p class="body">And they became this point of discussion through the entire country in the world where people sat down</p>
<p class="body">And you know, some people took Buckley side</p>
<p class="body">Some people did Gore Vidal side</p>
<p class="body">And this is how we sort things out</p>
<p class="body">We don't sort things out by silencing people</p>
<p class="body">We don't sort things out by saying you have an unacceptable position because it doesn't fit in with what I'm saying or it causes this or that, and it it's just and it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's a dangerous way</p>
<p class="body">To to set a precedent because you're filtering ideas, you're filtering ideas through your own standards, and I don't think that's good because I I think it's it's it's bad for you too</p>
<p class="body">It's bad for your ideas 'cause your ideas can't stand the vetting of of of an opposing position</p>
<p class="body">Then your ideas might suck and you maybe should look at them</p>
<p class="body">So maybe you're lazy and you don't want to go through the hassle of debate or or of like serious discourse, but if your ideas can't handle that kind of a discussion, you probably shouldn't have them</p>
<p class="body">You shouldn't adopt them</p>
<p class="body">You shouldn't be holding on to them</p>
<p class="body">That's my position on all this, and I think this whenever someone is trying to silence someone</p>
<p class="body">This it's more political than it is anything it's more</p>
<p class="body">This person has an incredible amount of influence and they don't align up very rigidly with what our ideology is, and they could cause us problems if they discuss certain things and</p>
<p class="body">An unorthodox way and we don't like that, so we're going to silence them and we're going to pretend that there's something that they're not, and we're going to do that openly, and it's going to be</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Obvious, yeah, and I think, and I think especially like look if you think the status quo is totally fine</p>
<p class="body">That like everything is the way that it should be</p>
<p class="body">I can, I guess, understand</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Who the **** thinks that? </p>
<p class="body">I don't know</p>
<p class="body">That's a crazy argument, right? </p>
<p class="body">There's not a single person alive that thinks everything is perfect, right? </p>
<p class="body">Is there? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, if so I haven't met them, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I never met him, so I don't think he can have that argument</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so I mean, if you think that there are things</p>
<p class="body">Really, seriously wrong with the society that you live in</p>
<p class="body">Right now have</p>
<p class="body">Discussion then then you like the last thing that you wanna do is to make it harder to get your ideas out about that out there so you know so people can</p>
<p class="body">People can talk about them people</p>
<p class="body">Can you know people can can hear about them, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I, I think that if you</p>
<p class="body">You know, if you want if you want to have like, you know, in my case you think that like we have, you know we have way too much economic inequality</p>
<p class="body">I think it's particularly crazy to support like more corporate censorship, because, again</p>
<p class="body">Who do you think who? </p>
<p class="body">Do you think is going to get censor right like like it? </p>
<p class="body">Like if it's you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean, if there's some Starbucks worker who's, like, you know, got fired when they're trying to organize a union, and Starbucks says that no, they weren't really fired for that</p>
<p class="body">It was really, you know, because they you know whatever is they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Showed up late, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know they showed up late</p>
<p class="body">I mean, OK, so somebody is lying</p>
<p class="body">Right, do we want you know Twitter or whatever platform to be making decisions about like who's lying and like oh which which which of these sides is misinformation</p>
<p class="body">I don't right like not just because like I support free speech, though I do, but also just because like I don't, I don't trust at all, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that they're going to take</p>
<p class="body">The side that I would want to on that course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So one of the things that I talked about when I made a video recently when they said that I was setting saying misinformation, and I was saying, well, look at what used to be misinformation just a few months ago</p>
<p class="body">That's now fact</p>
<p class="body">There's like the lab leak theory</p>
<p class="body">The lab leak theory</p>
<p class="body">If you said that before you get kicked off of social media, now it's on the front cover of Newsweek</p>
<p class="body">The the idea that if you get vaccinated, you can still spread COVID and you could still get COVID</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean it's yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That was crazy talk</p>
<p class="body">Rachel Maddow was on television, saying the virus stops with you</p>
<p class="body">You can't spread it, you can't catch it</p>
<p class="body">It stops with you if you're vaccinated</p>
<p class="body">That's not true</p>
<p class="body">We know that's not true, so that was if you said that I think people were vaccinated</p>
<p class="body">Can still catch COVID and they could still spread COVID</p>
<p class="body">That would be misinformation, but now that's accepted as fact</p>
<p class="body">There's a bunch of those</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean I think in that case</p>
<p class="body">I think that might be less like</p>
<p class="body">You know people didn't know that and more just kind of</p>
<p class="body">Rachel Maddow is an idiot because like if you, you know because what they always said is like the like</p>
<p class="body">You know, whatever it is, even for, like the original version of COVID that you know wild COVID whatever they call it, right they</p>
<p class="body">Like you know whatever 90 something you know percent you know like rate of effectiveness of like Pfizer or things you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, but if you read the literature, that's not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Really even accurate</p>
<p class="body">I mean what you know, but but this is the thing like whatever you think the effectiveness rate is, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like it was never 100% and if and if like Rachel Maddow thought it was 100%, that's like that. One seems more like an issue of, like Rachel Maddow not understanding, you know, medical science, but</p>
<p class="body">Again, I don't, I don't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Know that would make it misinformation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, yeah and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">So it's the same thing that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">My point, I mean, I mean like actually so here's an example</p>
<p class="body">I completely agree with at the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p class="body">Like back in was like March, you know 2020 maybe until sometime in April</p>
<p class="body">Fauci the CDC everybody was saying don't wear a mask, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know and</p>
<p class="body">You know, as we established, I'm not some you know, like there are a lot of things that I would rather spend my time on than like trying to sort through all the COVID stuff but like</p>
<p class="body">Even high at the time was like, well, you would think that doesn't make sense</p>
<p class="body">Why not, right, like you know what? </p>
<p class="body">Why would that like the reasons they were given didn't make sense to me</p>
<p class="body">And then they kind of said</p>
<p class="body">I mean like I know some people say this is an oversimplification, but I think if you go back and look at this is kind of what they said</p>
<p class="body">Oh, we lied about that</p>
<p class="body">So that like all the masks, wouldn't get, you know get bought up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's not an oversimplification simplification at all, that's exactly what they said and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And and which is crazy to like the thing that's crazy to me is like OK? </p>
<p class="body">If you're gonna do that, and I think you should have done it, but if you're gonna do that like you have to resign after that, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like, once you've once you've like shown that you were willing to like lie, lie to people like like like if if you think it's important that people trust you, know medical authorities which you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I can see why public health crisis you know that you think that was important, like what's going to undermine that</p>
<p class="body">More right people, you know, random people on the Internet, you know like saying things that you know that might not be true about it, or you know</p>
<p class="body">Or people going on podcasts. You know who who might say things that are wrong or like CD's</p>
<p class="body">See like admitting that they were lying about something, something important that's gonna that's gonna undermine that</p>
<p class="body">That's going to undermine that like crazy and I would not have wanted people who were pointing things like this out at the time that like oh the stated reasons why masks were supposed to be bad didn't really make sense, which they didn't write, you know, 'cause it was like? </p>
<p class="body">Well, it's going to encourage people to be reckless</p>
<p class="body">It's like, well, OK, that's an argument</p>
<p class="body">It's like seatbelts, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't think that was the courage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That was one that was one that they used right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, but not fancy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't think fouchy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Used that argument. Yeah, I think The Who did like</p>
<p class="body">I think there was like if you go with their website, I think that's one of the things that they said there at one point</p>
<p class="body">But they also say, well, people don't know how to use them properly</p>
<p class="body">So like they're going to like end up, it's going to end up being more dangerous</p>
<p class="body">You know there are a bunch of things they threw out</p>
<p class="body">None of it quite seemed to add up</p>
<p class="body">You know, even at the you know, even at the time and then again then they came out and said no</p>
<p class="body">Actually, like it's not like the science changed, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know when that happened and I and I think that I certainly wouldn't have wanted people who were pointing that out to not be able to do that because of some misinformation policy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Don't you think? </p>
<p class="body">That the issue really was that people were afraid</p>
<p class="body">And when people are afraid, then they'll will support harsher measures to ensure safety</p>
<p class="body">And one of those measures would be to silence people that may be spreading information that could get people in trouble, so they're willing to compromise their values because they think there's a greater good to be high, like there's a different time, and that's one of the more dangerous things about a thing like a pandemic</p>
<p class="body">Because people will compromise their positions because they feel like there's a greater good to be achieved, and so we need to silence these people like this was during the presidential campaign</p>
<p class="body">And this is one of the things that I found out that I that I was really shocked by that Twitter band, Bret Weinstein had a thing that he had put together called</p>
<p class="body">Unity 2020 and the idea was</p>
<p class="body">Instead of this rigid two party system where you have people that left and people the right, what if you had like a really reasonable person? </p>
<p class="body">Well balanced person from the right and a really reasonable, well balanced person from the left and we brought them together</p>
<p class="body">Very popular people and put together like a party and call it like the Unity Party</p>
<p class="body">And so he made a</p>
<p class="body">Twitter page and and Twitter banned the page</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And what was the reason the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Gift some ******** reason, but the reason was they were terrified that these popular podcasters and people were going to take votes away from the left</p>
<p class="body">Because these people like Weinstein and his wife or their progressives</p>
<p class="body">I mean they taught at a very progressive university</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of people that are progressive that feel disenfranchised with some of the standards</p>
<p class="body">Of the Democratic Party, and they weren't really interested in a guy like Biden</p>
<p class="body">Who is this career politician who's basically full of **** and having him be president like aren't there aren't more reasonable, more attractive alternatives, so they put together this thing and Twitter</p>
0:00:00 <h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">In the 90</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Six that this. This is exactly the same. They were worried that like that can FCK up an election if you get enough people that say hey you guys are making a lot of sense, I'm going to vote Unity 2020. If that becomes a big thing, like in the Republicans aren't going to vote Unity 2020, they're going to stick with their base. They're going to stick with their guy. They're Trump people</p>
<p class="body">We got a guy. He's our winner and they were worried and concerned. I think that this Unity 2020 thing, even if it's like 10,000 votes in this place and 5000 votes at that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah it does</p>
<p class="body">It does</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't take that much to like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It doesn't take that much to swing elections</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No, definitely not. Yeah, I mean look, I certainly wouldn't have voted for you to do 2020</p>
<p class="body">I think that the Democrats and Republicans are too close together in their positions</p>
<p class="body">Already, right? </p>
<p class="body">There's there are too many things where where they that they basically agree on that</p>
<p class="body">I don't like you know, but but I certainly don't think that you should be banned for Twitter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's crazy, but that's the thing about these social media platforms is that they've become too big</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">For you know like this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're they</p>
<p class="body">They have too much influence</p>
<p class="body">It's not as simple as like this is a private business</p>
<p class="body">They can do whatever they want like this private business is the way that people distribute information to billions and billions of people</p>
<p class="body">The idea that Facebook is just a private business is bananas</p>
'cause it literally influences worldwide elections and it comes standard on your phone</p>
<p class="body">In many countries it</p>
<p class="body">Is the Internet to a lot of people in other countries the idea that that's just a private company is crazy? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the thing that's particularly crazy to me is like look, I understand like a like a conservative or libertarian</p>
<p class="body">You know who'd say that, uh, their private business</p>
<p class="body">They could do whatever they want, 'cause that's what they would say about everything, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that, like private businesses should be able to do what they want and like you know and</p>
<p class="body">And obviously</p>
<p class="body">You know I'm a I'm a socialist I really disagree with that right? </p>
<p class="body">But like what's crazy to me is when people who are on the left who say that who want there to be more</p>
<p class="body">You know lots of restrictions that I agree with, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know on on private businesses, then turn around and say, oh, this isn't really a free speech issue</p>
'cause it's like a private business, it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right 'cause it supports their their desires</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Like wait a second guys</p>

<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know which one is it right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean like like</p>
<p class="body">Like I said, you know, because if you if you are on the left and I don't mean like if you're a liberal but like if you're a real leftist, then I would say that you know a lot of the core of like your worldview is that you understand that private businesses can have a crazy amount of power over people</p>
<p class="body">Lives and that can be, you know in certain respects, as dangerous as as you know, the power of governments and and of course the two are not unrelated, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because private businesses like we're talking about earlier have a crazy amount of influence over what the over, what the government does</p>
<p class="body">So like</p>
<p class="body">Do you like, I think, wanting private corporations? </p>
<p class="body">To be more powerful, because you think that it's going to silence like just the people that you don't like, that's the problem</p>
<p class="body">Seems like it it just it just always seems like you haven't thought this through at</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">All no, but that that's the problem and this is where I come to you with this</p>
<p class="body">Like how do we get people on the left to realize that this is a tremendous error and that is not? </p>
<p class="body">Just I understand that they think that short term this is beneficial 'cause they can silence people they disagree with</p>
<p class="body">But to understand that for</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it sounds a little grand, but for the human race this is a terrible thing to have</p>
<p class="body">It's a terrible thing to have because you're discouraging discourse, and it's one of the most important things that we have is the ability to talk things out</p>
<p class="body">The ability to find out how a person thinks and to consider how that person thinks</p>
<p class="body">And whether or not that</p>
<p class="body">Would apply to you like can I use these thoughts is that they have a point that I haven't considered</p>
<p class="body">Is there something about the way they're looking at the world that maybe there is a perspective that I have either ignored or I just haven't been aware of that will enlighten me and change the way I look at things? </p>
<p class="body">Maybe I look at a person</p>
<p class="body">Coming from a different walk of life from a different part of the world or different, what a different education, whatever it is like</p>
<p class="body">Let me take in their point of view and see see if this is helpful</p>
<p class="body">See if I can help</p>
<p class="body">See, we can we we need more friends than we need enemies we don't need more enemies so this silencing people or you're just crazy</p>
<p class="body">Enemies, you're polarizing</p>
<p class="body">We need communication</p>
<p class="body">We need it for most people</p>
<p class="body">Want the same thing when I turn in terms of like what do you want from life? </p>
<p class="body">You want your friends, your family, your loved ones to be happy? </p>
<p class="body">You want to be able to pursue your interests and your dreams and your goals</p>
<p class="body">You have these ideas and these projects you want to do these goals you want to achieve</p>
<p class="body">You want to be able to pursue those</p>
<p class="body">And you want to not be hammered by ******** while you're trying to do that</p>
<p class="body">And you also</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Want to be? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">A good person like that's universal stuff</p>
<p class="body">Then it comes to like, well, what is a good person like? </p>
<p class="body">What should you be allowed to do and what you should you not be allowed to do? </p>
<p class="body">How do you infringe upon the rights of your neighbors with your ideas? </p>
<p class="body">Do do you support the community with your ideas is beneficial to people? </p>
<p class="body">And these are all where things get weird and then we get ideologically driven into a left or right category</p>
<p class="body">And I believe that many people that are either on the left or on the right are just looking for a gang</p>
<p class="body">They're just looking for a gang to be in and they find it and they just adopt their positions and they adopt this predetermined pattern of thinking</p>
<p class="body">And this ideology that they subscribe to because other people on the left do it, or other people in the right do it</p>
<p class="body">And when you do it, those people in the right like yeah, good for you</p>
<p class="body">Good for you, Ben</p>
<p class="body">You're thinking the right way</p>
<p class="body">Now you're on our side and there's like for human beings</p>
<p class="body">There's a great feeling of camaraderie that comes with that</p>
<p class="body">You're you're part of a tribe</p>
<p class="body">It's very attractive</p>
<p class="body">And it's it's that's a problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and I think it's also a problem when, like, how are the tribes being divided up and is it in a way that's going to actually advance the things that you want, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like as if? </p>
<p class="body">If it's really about like different regions of the country, or like you know for the diminishing number of people still watch cable news, you know which cable news channel you know you, you you watch</p>
<p class="body">And you know, basically, it's it's like you know, Red team versus Blue Team culture, war stuff, right then? </p>
<p class="body">Then I guess the question is, are you ever going to get the kinds of systemic changes that would really help people to do a lot of the things we just talked about right? </p>
<p class="body">Like have like? </p>
<p class="body">You know, be able to, you know, for example, like lots of people can't spend very much time with their families</p>
<p class="body">You know 'cause, 'cause 'cause they have to work all the time</p>
<p class="body">You know lots of people can't do the things they want to do in their life because</p>
<p class="body">You know they can't go to school, you know, because you know like higher education because you know they they can't</p>
<p class="body">You know they can afford it or they they don't want to be like saddled with decades</p>
<p class="body">You know of of debt about it, and and so the question is like how are you going to achieve? </p>
<p class="body">Those things, and if you're if there's somebody standing in the way, who who is it actually right? </p>
<p class="body">Is it somebody who's a member of you know, the elite who has like genuine power, right? </p>
<p class="body">And who's whose interests might not let coincide with with your interest, right? </p>
<p class="body">Because like there are, you know, like if you had a union at your workplace, or if you had like</p>
<p class="body">You know, then their profits would go down, or if you tax them more to pay for some of the things we're talking about, you know like that, you know, like that would be bad for them</p>
<p class="body">Is it them or is it like your uncle who, like you know, whatever like like you know, voted for Trump or something, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like is is which? </p>
<p class="body">Which one of those people should should you get mad about? </p>
<p class="body">And I think that the problem is that a lot of people are trained to just like fixate on this</p>
<p class="body">Whatever, just passing ******** is going on in the news cycle</p>
<p class="body">You know that like what are people mad about? </p>
<p class="body">This minute you know it's it's going to be something else in 12 hours, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, but like there there there's this sort of constant</p>
<p class="body">Outrage cycle that I think is fed by the profit incentives of of media companies because they have to hold on to the audience they</p>
<p class="body">Have left well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Also, they have advertisers</p>
<p class="body">A lot of those advertisers you know brought to you by Pfizer</p>
<p class="body">They have these ideas that you have to subscribe to, and if you don't subscribe to those ideas</p>
<p class="body">Then they don't want to support your program, and this is like either</p>
<p class="body">A said or unsaid thing</p>
<p class="body">It's like I was listening to this thing where these people were talking about people in positions of power</p>
<p class="body">Like how do you get these like sort of cookie cutter politicians? </p>
<p class="body">Are they told what to do or are they the kind of people that will do what they think and say what they think? </p>
<p class="body">Other people want them to say, and I think there's a lot of that</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of they don't really necessarily have these principled positions</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What they're doing is they're saying the thing they think that people want them to say they they're saying the thing they believe people want to hear and that that's going to advance them in their career</p>
<p class="body">And there are these, you know, we don't have to name the names, but we know these people</p>
<p class="body">These cookie cutter type politicians we know are full of **** but they say things that are the right things to say given the current political or social climate</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean look, remember and and they'll also say what they think they have to say, like at a given point</p>
<p class="body">And then it's like completely forgotten six months later, sometimes right? Like that. Like, think about the 2020 election</p>
<p class="body">Like all of those Democrats who some of them said at the beginning of the primaries that they agreed with Bernie about Medicare for all but even the ones who didn't, right? </p>
<p class="body">They would all say, oh, we at least think there should be this public option</p>
<p class="body">Where everybody should be able to like maybe</p>
<p class="body">Buy into some sort of public health insurance, whatever</p>
<p class="body">And that was like the entire debate. There were like 100, you know whatever I don't, I don't know how many democratic debates there were</p>
<p class="body">It felt like a million, but they have like however many there were</p>
<p class="body">This was always at least like 20 minutes like every single one of those like they would go on and on about this</p>
<p class="body">But then like somehow now</p>
<p class="body">That's just disappeared, right? </p>
<p class="body">Nobody is like like like now Biden President</p>
<p class="body">It still says on his campaign website</p>
<p class="body">You know that that never got taken down, right? </p>
<p class="body">That he wants there to be this public health insurance option</p>
<p class="body">Kamala Harris, who said at one point that she agreed with Bertie about Medicare for all, is the vice president</p>
<p class="body">A lot of these other people are, you know, Pete Buttigieg, you know, said he wanted at least Medicare for all who wanted</p>
<p class="body">And like he's you know, he's in the cabinet</p>
<p class="body">There are all these people who are back to being senators</p>
<p class="body">And it's it's like, well, that's what they you know when they had to position themselves to win that primary, they said that they cared about</p>
<p class="body">Like all you know, the millions of Americans who don't have health care or they like 1,000,000 more who maybe even do have health care</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But they said they were going to decriminalize marijuana and release everybody that</p>
<p class="body">Was in jail for it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, once that</p>
<p class="body">Happened exactly</p>
<p class="body">It's all ******** like it's all ******** with that</p>
<p class="body">That is the sort of stuff that we're talking about that they don't really believe these things</p>
<p class="body">They're saying these things because they believe this is what people want to hear, and that gets those people out to the polls that get</p>
<p class="body">That's get to get those people out to the booths and get them to vote, and this is unfortunately where we find ourselves as a culture until we can read minds and Elon Musk</p>
<p class="body">Hurry up with that technology. We need to be actually able to read people's</p>
<p class="body">Minds bring it back to you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">So yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't know that I want</p>
<p class="body">A lot to be able to read my mind, you're gonna read it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You can read his mind too though, and you're going to see, Oh my God</p>
<p class="body">Why did you write? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">This book, yeah, I wrote this book because I was ****** *** like I think more than any other books that I've read and it came out of like intense frustration that I was feeling at that time because I saw a lot of people who I think like</p>
<p class="body">On paper you know they agree with me about like most of what I've said tonight, maybe not the, you know, maybe not the free speech part, but like you know, most of the rest of it, like who were doing all of these things that seem to me like they were either feeding into these absolutely ridiculous sideshows that like stop people from actually focusing on these issues that we're talking about</p>
<p class="body">You know, like you know the the title, right? </p>
<p class="body">The title example you know canceling comedians</p>
<p class="body">You know people who would like</p>
<p class="body">Freak out, you know about like what Dave Chappelle says in a stand up special, as if like the things that you say in a stand up special or like an editorial that you're writing for the New York Times about like exactly what you want to happen, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like then like every every sentence you know, Dave Chappelle has said in the stand up special is literally what he thinks</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And you know, and I think that like one to anybody, you're trying to appeal to, like, actually</p>
<p class="body">Build some kind of like political program to actually accomplishing the stuff we've talked about, like what does that make you look like that makes you look like an overgrown hall monitor, right? </p>
<p class="body">Nobody is going to want to follow that person anywhere, nor should they write like that</p>
<p class="body">They 'cause, 'cause that's that's just</p>
<p class="body">Incredibly damaging and unappealing and and I and I wanted like, I mean it's funny because I I think that like</p>
<p class="body">When I sort of use that as the example in the title, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I was kind of trying to come up with like the most ridiculous example that I could come up with, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like you know that like people would be like</p>
<p class="body">You know, in terms of like ridiculous priorities or sort of people being like weird, moralistic scolds like</p>
<p class="body">You know what would be the biggest example? </p>
<p class="body">Not getting mad at like corporate CEOs who bust unions not, you know, not getting mad at like you know politicians who commit war crimes but you know or or you know like maybe you get mad at those people too</p>
<p class="body">But like somehow</p>
<p class="body">You know my my friend</p>
<p class="body">I disagree with him about a lot</p>
<p class="body">A lot of things, a lot of things, but the but he is my friend Dave Smith, you know, heard him talk</p>
<p class="body">About the outrage budget right, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How dare you disagree with Dave Smith about anything? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I'm pretty sure that he disagrees with a whole lot of things</p>
<p class="body">You agreed with us that earlier, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's awesome, I'm just</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Joking, yeah, but no</p>
<p class="body">I mean like probably I think he is a</p>
<p class="body">I think he is a good guy and he's you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean I've I've been</p>
<p class="body">You know, I've been on this show several times and he's well, he's yeah he has, he has</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's thought out perspectives</p>
<p class="body">You may agree or may not agree, but you can see where where he's coming from</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I could see where it's coming from and the other thing that I I really respect about him is that I think that like a lot of a lot of libertarians</p>
<p class="body">Like, even though they'll like agree on paper, you know like that like with you know, yeah, we shouldn't be fighting</p>
<p class="body">You know we shouldn't be fighting these wars, you know we</p>
<p class="body">We should like</p>
<p class="body">There shouldn't be all these people in prison or whatever</p>
<p class="body">It seems like in practice what really gets them excited is like tax cuts, right? </p>
<p class="body">And I think that</p>
<p class="body">And I think Dave is genuinely not like that</p>
<p class="body">I think that he actually like like devotes way as far as I've ever been able to see</p>
<p class="body">He actually devotes way less time to stuff like that than to like the United States backing this genocidal sat in war in in Yemen like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the big thing with Dave</p>
<p class="body">It's it's interventionist foreign policy and the corporate backing of these horrible regime change wars</p>
<p class="body">That's that's the thing that he hates more than anything, and the actual cost of human lives and suffering</p>
<p class="body">You know he's a deeply compassionate person, he really</p>
<p class="body">Firmly opposes these things and he wants to talk about them whenever he can</p>
<p class="body">And it's</p>
<p class="body">It's one of those things where I mean he talked on my podcast about how that got him kind of booted off of those political talk shows on cable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Nobody wants to hear about dead kids in Yemen like what they're what they want to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Exactly exactly</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Hear about is like whatever culture war thing people are screaming about each other, you know</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Whether that Upenn swimmer should be able to compete with women, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah</p>
<p class="body">Which way? </p>
<p class="body">By the way I love the thing that I love most about that example is whatever you think about it, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like and I you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean look if if I had to like actually think about it pressing or whatever, let them</p>
<p class="body">You know I don't care, right, you know</p>
<p class="body">But like that whatever you think about it</p>
<p class="body">Like the idea that everybody is going to get this excited about something happens in Ivy League swim meet</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<p class="body">Like that they had, like it's like, really, that's what you care about</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Very odd</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Like rich kids like swimming like that</p>
<p class="body">That's that's not really what I care about, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I know, it's not what I want people to care about, so so I mean whatever</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's also, but it's it's a lightning rod for this discussion of like what is a woman? </p>
<p class="body">And but this is a new part of the ideology</p>
<p class="body">This is a new discussion, like what makes a woman? </p>
<p class="body">Is it biology or is it how you identify is how you feel? </p>
<p class="body">Or is it your chromosomes and? </p>
<p class="body">This when it comes to sports sports, is where the rubber heats hits the road and that's why it's this sort of it's like see we told you there's a difference when someone is lapping people and they're they're identifying as female, but they're a biological male and they're destroying the competition</p>
<p class="body">But when they competed as a biological male, which</p>
<p class="body">Was just a little while</p>
<p class="body">Ago they were not very good</p>
<p class="body">They were OK, but they weren't</p>
<p class="body">They weren't nowhere near the top ten, and now they're dominant</p>

<p class="body">OK</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The number one in the country like this is a it's a</p>
<p class="body">It's a very interesting discussion of where the rubber meets the road in terms like what defines</p>
<p class="body">Who you are and and also like are we talking about how you treat a person or are we talking about competition and so there's a reason why men can't compete with women like as a biological male? </p>
<p class="body">You who identifies the biological male you are not allowed to compete in the women's division. There's a reason why there's a division between men and women so</p>
<p class="body">When we make this distinction, what? </p>
<p class="body">What is the criteria that we allow someone to cross that distinction and be a female or be a male? </p>
<p class="body">And this is nothing to do with cruelty or bigotry or discrimination</p>
<p class="body">This is just a discussion about what is a woman and what is a man and sports</p>
<p class="body">Or a great way to sort that out when it comes to this particular aspect of it</p>
<p class="body">The physical aspect of being a female or a male another is birth</p>
<p class="body">You know, like can you get pregnant? </p>
<p class="body">Can you give birth? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, if there's a competition like who's going to create the most babies and it's males versus females and it's people who identify versus? </p>
<p class="body">As a female versus people who are biologically female, well the biological females are going to dominate that competition</p>
<p class="body">I know, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I'm saying no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, you know I'm saying it's like it's where the rubber meets the road in in terms of like these ideological discussions, which are valid discussions, they're valid discussions</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I I know what you're I, I know, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
'cause I've I've met a lot of trans people that like I had Blaire, White white on the podcast recently</p>
<p class="body">I mean when you meet Blaire White you there's not a ******* doubt in your mind like this is someone who for whatever reason</p>
<p class="body">The nature and genetics have given the wrong sex to a person that is distinctly female</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean as far as like the actual rules for like sports leagues, I I know, I'm sure you know way more about this than I do</p>
<p class="body">But like I have a I know different like sports have handled it differently in terms of the requirements that like it's not necessarily an absolute thing like</p>
<p class="body">You know trend, you know? </p>
<p class="body">Trans women can or can't you know, compete? </p>
<p class="body">Like sometimes you know there are like hormone requirements and stuff like that</p>
<p class="body">You know that there are there are different ways of trying to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You know what the hormone requirements are? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Though no, no, I've I have, I have no</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's where it gets weird</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Idea, right? That's the threshold</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Old, for many sports it means handled differently in different places, but this guy named Derek</p>
<p class="body">He's got a website called</p>
<p class="body">It's a silly name or website</p>
<p class="body">It's called more plates, more dates</p>
<p class="body">It's like something you create a long time ago, but he's</p>
<p class="body">He doesn't</p>
<p class="body">I don't think he necessarily has a degree in chemistry in biochemistry, but he has a deep understanding of it and the way he was breaking down the amount of available testosterone that a biological female has like the threshold versus what's acceptable for a trans woman to compete</p>
<p class="body">Against biological females, and it's substantially more like it's on the outskirts of like physiological normality</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean again, I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't know what like if there's a good compromise here that would like help like you know that would maintain a reasonable level of fairness</p>
<p class="body">You know, without without you know, without just saying like you know, I think there are like legitimately a couple different</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I don't know what it is either</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know couple of different values that you have to balance to like try to figure that one out</p>
<p class="body">I would say that I think like most contexts like you know, most of the things that trans people</p>
<p class="body">You know who are like advocating for you? </p>
<p class="body">Know more anti discrimination laws etc</p>
<p class="body">Talking about are not going to be nearly as hard as like this kind of like edge case about you know about sports right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, yeah no, I agree with that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Because you know 'cause like? </p>
<p class="body">I think it's mostly like</p>
<p class="body">Can you be like you know, like employment and housing and you know and and all of that stuff? </p>
<p class="body">And and I think it is like I think it is important that you know that you have</p>
<p class="body">You know that you do you have you know civil rights laws that you know that that cover everybody</p>
<p class="body">Now I do think that because of some of the</p>
<p class="body">Weird dynamics of this particular issue, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like you know, you're going to get like things that are harder calls, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like like this, like sports</p>
<p class="body">Yeah and I I again I just like in terms of like what some sports league should require in terms of you know hormones or whatever</p>
<p class="body">Like I have absolutely no idea, but again, I I think that it's</p>
<p class="body">This is</p>
<p class="body">This is not like</p>
<p class="body">In terms of things that I'm going to get like mad about, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, on a on a day to day basis, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well you would if you had a daughter that was competing against that person</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, maybe you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Someone who had been training their whole life to be an elite swimmer in a dedicated massive amount of time and someone came around that had a a massive biological advantage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, although of course if I had a trans daughter you know then then I'd want to make sure that whatever the rules were, we're going to be fair to her too, which is why, like again, you know, like what the right sort of</p>
<p class="body">Exactly where the rules should be set</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you think if you had a trans daughter and your trans daughter competed as a male for many many years and was just sort of mediocre and then all of a sudden competed as a woman and started dominating? </p>
<p class="body">Don't you think you'd feel a little bit of guilt? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, I guess it depends how much like how much she was</p>
<p class="body">You know, like how much we're talking about, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like 'cause like I think in that in that swim meet case the the Upenn, the Upenn thing that you mentioned earlier</p>
<p class="body">If I'm remembering right like and maybe you can correct me on this like like what I know about this is like</p>
<p class="body">Scrolling through Twitter, you know, like you know what I saw</p>
<p class="body">But like, I don't think that she even won by that much</p>
<p class="body">Did she or did she? </p>
<p class="body">Giant amount giant amount? </p>
<p class="body">How much? </p>
<p class="body">How much did she? </p>
<p class="body">How much did she win by? </p>
<p class="body">I thought it was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK, let's find out she's breaking records</p>
<p class="body">I mean, she's breaking records in in multiple meets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah, yeah, I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Again, I mean, this is what The thing is like</p>
<p class="body">There's a video of her literally lapping the other female swimmers</p>
<p class="body">And this is again, this is when we're talking before one of the things we brought up is the Lakota culture has this term, and this term is called the heyoka, and the heyoka is the sacred clown</p>
<p class="body">It's a part of their culture where someone makes fun of everything and it's like a sacred part of their culture</p>
<p class="body">Where they subject everything to mockery and anything that can't stand up to mockery</p>
<p class="body">Anything that like viciously defends itself against mockery</p>
<p class="body">That's an illegitimate thing</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, another thing that Lakota people had was</p>
<p class="body">What their version of a transgender person was, and it was also a sacred part of their culture because it was a wise person that understood both genders and this person</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Spirit or something? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You could come to and they had a deeper understanding of what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a man</p>
<p class="body">Because they</p>
<p class="body">Essentially were both</p>
<p class="body">And so there they had a deep amount of respect for people who were trans in their culture and</p>
<p class="body">I think that's a great way of approaching it that</p>
<p class="body">Whenever you have these unique circumstances, someone who is biologically male but clearly is much more of a female, sometimes more of a female than a lot of biological females who are much more biologically female</p>
<p class="body">You know much more oriented towards male thinking and male behavior</p>
<p class="body">I mean this all of this</p>
<p class="body">Is good for everybody</p>
<p class="body">It's it's good for us to accept</p>
<p class="body">And it's good for us to learn from these perspectives of these people that have very unique and and and different, but also common in terms of like when you have giant numbers of people like hundreds of millions of people, you have quite a few people that have these experiences and we can learn from them</p>
<p class="body">And instead of</p>
<p class="body">Discrimination, and I mean, I don't necessarily think sports is a discrimination, though that's where it gets weird, because like there's again, there's a reason why we make a distinction</p>
<p class="body">Why males compete against males and females compete against females? </p>
<p class="body">And I think we need to sort that out and</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That, but you don't</p>
<p class="body">You don't think like</p>
<p class="body">Like, do you think that there is some sort of reasonable compromise to be arrived out there or what's? </p>
<p class="body">Your position with physical sports</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's a problem because there's so many benefits to being a biological male</p>
<p class="body">There's so many benefits the size of the lungs, the size of the heart, the physical strength, the fact that you're going through puberty, and that's the difference between someone who goes through puberty and maybe someone who doesn't</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, the transition before that, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Maybe someone would be right there</p>
<p class="body">So and then there's the ethical dilemma about that</p>
<p class="body">Like should you do that? </p>
<p class="body">Because there's a great deal of people that have not done that and wound up becoming gay men</p>
<p class="body">And so is that what it like</p>
<p class="body">What's the right choice and who can make that choice? </p>
<p class="body">And when do you have the ability to make that choice? </p>
<p class="body">Should you be able to make that choice as a child? </p>
<p class="body">Should you wait till you're an adult, you know we we we there's a lot of decisions that we don't allow people to make until they're of grown age</p>
<p class="body">Like tattoos, you can't get your face tattooed when you're 4, but you can. When you're 24, you know it's it's it's</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I'm not saying that they're the same thing, but what I am</p>
<p class="body">Saying is that we</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">But it's so hard it's hard issue, right? </p>

<p class="body">We are</p>

<p class="body">Faced with we're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Because yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Faced with many dilemmas that require discussions and</p>
<p class="body">Comprehensive discussions and the only way you can do that is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Without censorship, well yeah</p>
<p class="body">I mean, obviously I completely agree on that, I mean</p>
<p class="body">I think that the</p>
<p class="body">You know youth transition thing, you know</p>
<p class="body">Again, I think that this is like this is a a little bit of a hard case because I think that</p>
<p class="body">On the one hand, yeah, you're absolutely right</p>
<p class="body">I mean, the idea, like you know, no sane person thinks that like little kids should have complete medical autonomy and just like get to like do whatever they want</p>
<p class="body">That would be</p>
<p class="body">Ridiculous, but at the same time like not getting a tattoo when you're a kid isn't going to like have some like really bad effect</p>
<p class="body">You could just wave and that's fine</p>
<p class="body">Right like? </p>
<p class="body">Whereas like with something like this</p>
<p class="body">If that's not dealt with</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We can only imagine</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, yeah, exactly like I, I literally don't know, but it sounds like it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Neither of us know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">But I I think that like then like having to go through what, from your perspective, is the wrong, is the wrong puberty, right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, like the stakes are higher that two thing right now</p>
<p class="body">What does that mean in terms of like what level of medical gatekeeping there should be or like what the clinical practices should be? </p>
<p class="body">I'm like the last person to to say, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm the last person to say too. I just think it has to be something we can discuss. The problem is when people want to suppress people's ability to make choices, and when people want to suppress people's ability to discuss these things</p>
<p class="body">I don't think that's good for any of us</p>
<p class="body">I mean, these are very complicated human issues, and by human issues I put them in the same category as a lot of</p>
<p class="body">Other things that are very messy</p>
<p class="body">They're complicated to talk about their human issues, you know</p>
<p class="body">And this is one of them</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, no</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's</p>
<p class="body">It's certainly it certainly is</p>
<p class="body">And I also think that again, it goes back to like one of the big points in the book, which is that I don't want</p>
<p class="body">Like people who might be like if you've thought about one of these issues, we're talking about a lot, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like and and you and you</p>
<p class="body">You think like you have</p>
<p class="body">And you might get very impatient right with people who who you think are, you know, are wrong about them</p>
<p class="body">You think that they they have? </p>
<p class="body">You know they haven't thought about it as much as you</p>
<p class="body">Maybe then and you know you think that they're not like sensitive enough to like what people might need then</p>
<p class="body">Like if you're just sort of writing somebody off, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that like they're done because because they're not like you know, they haven't evolved to exactly where you think they should evolve to yet</p>
<p class="body">I think that that's bad on a human level</p>
<p class="body">That's just a bad way to interact with people and, and I also think that it's I think it's bad politically because</p>
<p class="body">You know somebody could like on some like incredibly messy, sensitive issue, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like like they could</p>
<p class="body">You know, like they could, they could land somewhere different from you on that, and I'm not saying that like there wasn't a bottom line like I think there is a bottom line, I think like nondiscrimination laws, stuff like that, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I think that's</p>
<p class="body">Incredibly important, but I think that if you're writing people off based on that stuff when it could be that there are all these other things where you could actually get them on board with what you want</p>
<p class="body">Right, and instead of saying, like</p>
<p class="body">You know when you when you said in 2020 that you were probably going to vote for Bernie and there were people who? </p>
<p class="body">There are people who freaked out about it and a lot of that was like bad faith</p>
<p class="body">It was like ginned up by supporters of other candidates, but there were people who were like</p>
<p class="body">You know real leftists who who were like mad that like Bernie that Bernie campaign like put out that like video where they were like you know clipping that</p>
<p class="body">And then</p>
<p class="body">And that seemed crazy to me, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like Michael, Michael Brooks and I wrote an article for Jacobin about it at the at the time</p>
<p class="body">And like like it</p>
<p class="body">Just seems to me like you know, whatever like</p>
<p class="body">The idea that instead of being like oh, hey, good like here are all these things we could agree on</p>
<p class="body">We think ration of healthcare and you're willing to like support this</p>
<p class="body">And by the way, like if you you know if you really care about you know trans people</p>
<p class="body">I mean like I think you know, Bernie Sanders would probably your guy, right? </p>
<p class="body">It made like that they use the, you know he wanted to fund, you know, transition costs</p>
<p class="body">You know part of Medicare</p>
<p class="body">For all you know, like that</p>
<p class="body">That would be, that would be the most you know pro trans position</p>
<p class="body">But like if you're going to say</p>
<p class="body">Like you know somebody you know</p>
<p class="body">Like if you think, oh Joe Rogan is wrong about like exactly how like sports</p>
<p class="body">You know the sports issue should be and it should play out</p>
<p class="body">So I don't care that there are all these other things right that he that he agrees with us about</p>
<p class="body">I don't care if he's willing to support this thing, that would be incredibly beneficial</p>
<p class="body">You know, like we just need to like cast him out, right? </p>
<p class="body">Say like say like no, we just want nothing to do with you or maybe like once you agree with us on 100% of everything. And like you know, repent right? You know then maybe</p>
<p class="body">Then maybe we'll have something to do with you</p>
<p class="body">I think that that's I think that's a I think that's a stupid, and I think it's a self defeating way to like</p>
<p class="body">Try to do politics and I I think it's I think it's also just a</p>
<p class="body">Bad way to live your life</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, I agree with you that writing people off because they don't share all of your opinions is ridiculous</p>
<p class="body">And it's not the way you get people to</p>
<p class="body">To take your position, it's the opposite. They're going to push back. They're going to push back, and you're going to reject people because they don't agree with 100% of your positions they're going to</p>
<p class="body">They're going to dig their heels in</p>
<p class="body">That's a natural thing with human beings</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">They're not going</p>
<p class="body">To go woo Orguss will change</p>
<p class="body">Now, that's not what they do man</p>
<p class="body">They they ******* dig in</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, nobody has ever said like you know, like nobody has ever been in like an argument on you know whatever Facebook where you know somebody you know like</p>
<p class="body">Somebody says you know, somebody says that they're a terrible person and they're you know, whatever, they're, uh</p>
<p class="body">You know they're a fascist or Stalinist or whatever it is they're being accused of being right, you know and said</p>
<p class="body">Oh, you know? </p>
<p class="body">What you're right, you're right</p>
<p class="body">Good point, good point, good point right, you know like that now I get it right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah I did, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, like that's that's not actually how you, how you appeal to you know to human beings at all</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">At all</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, like anybody who knows like that's like that's something that like I think and</p>
<p class="body">Alien within like 10 minutes of interacting with people would recognize is not going to work right</p>
<p class="body">I mean like I think if you talk to people like their people like you</p>
<p class="body">You know, like you're taking what they're saying seriously, like if you, if you think they're wrong, you can like</p>
<p class="body">Try to explain why you think you think they're wrong and you can show them how the things that you want might actually help them</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it's not always going to work</p>
<p class="body">There's no guarantee 'cause that's just life</p>
<p class="body">You know there's no guarantee, but I mean like</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes it'll work and the other thing is just not</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Going to work</p>
<p class="body">So what positions did you take in your book that you got pushback from? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh boy so</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, well there were</p>
<p class="body">There were a few, although I will say most people who got mad at the book didn't read</p>
<p class="body">It, like most people you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Of course, why would they bother reading him when they could? </p>
<p class="body">Just get mad, yeah? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean there</p>
<p class="body">Were like, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">What if I read it clouds my judgement, because now I agree with you on some things</p>
<p class="body">I'm trying to say **** you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, exactly like there were</p>
<p class="body">There were so many like the number of people who got mad about the book before it came out</p>
<p class="body">Just based on the title or the description about this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Wanna have another drink before you talk? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, absolutely yeah yeah please</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're out, you're out of booze</p>
<p class="body">Might need a refill</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">This is really good</p>
<p class="body">Thank you Buffalo</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's good stuff</p>
<p class="body">So yeah, the number of people who got mad about it before it came out versus the number after I think is really revealing, but but</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">It's hilarious</p>
<p class="body">I mean it</p>
<p class="body">It's literally true, but I think the people, the people who did read it who got mad which is not</p>
<p class="body">Most people who read it, but the people who did read it who got mad</p>
<p class="body">I think there were a few things. One of them was about the the Andino incident from 2019. You remember this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Gianti for thing when they milkshakes at him and stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah through Yep Yep that they</p>
<p class="body">That, and in general the part of it where I was criticizing</p>
<p class="body">You know, Antifa, that they that like I think that they</p>
<p class="body">I think there are a lot of people you know who at least maybe not a lot of people in the world as a whole, but a lot of people within a certain kind of subculture who have</p>
<p class="body">You know, convince themselves that that, like I don't know, it's really important that people be using these kinds of like</p>
<p class="body">You know St tactics to like because they think in their heads that it's always like Germany in 1933 and like you know Nazis are about to take over or something which is delusional</p>
<p class="body">But they you know I, I think if you you know one of the points that I make about that in the book is that if you think about like what was actually going on in, you know Germany in the early 30s</p>
<p class="body">When you had</p>
<p class="body">You know, like Nazis who are like going around and like smashing up like trade union halls and like you know and and and fighting with people and like socialist and communist parties and stuff</p>
<p class="body">Why would any, like you know? </p>
<p class="body">Would corporate America have to bother with any of that now, right? </p>
<p class="body">They're already winning, you know, just fine</p>
<p class="body">You know, without it, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like so, OK, so sorry, let me sorry, let me</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't know what you're</p>
<p class="body">Saying I'm not confused</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Let me back up like try to be clear about this</p>
<p class="body">So I think the idea that fascism is what's like on the horizon</p>
<p class="body">In America, I don't think makes sense</p>
'cause I think that arose under very different circumstances than the than than what we've we've got right now</p>
<p class="body">I think that the rule</p>
<p class="body">That, like the things that the things that fascists were doing in like Germany before they took over there or Italy before they took over, there were in response to the perception that the system was under threat and there would be like</p>
<p class="body">Maybe even like communist revolution, and this was like the only thing that you know</p>
<p class="body">The only thing that like</p>
<p class="body">You know, the wealthy elites could kind of turn to to to stop that from happening</p>
<p class="body">You know would would be like allying with with the with, you know, the German entry business interests allied with Hitler</p>
<p class="body">And that's just such a radically different situation than the United States</p>
<p class="body">Now that I think the idea that you'd be obsessed with, like</p>
<p class="body">Street fighting with you know with like the few people who like you, know the Richard Spencer types or whatever</p>
<p class="body">Just seems I, I think that's I think that makes no sense</p>
<p class="body">I think that it's it's a</p>
<p class="body">I think it's a diversion</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I think it's a distraction, honestly</p>
<p class="body">You know from things that actually matter more, and I think that it's really dangerous when people would make excuses for</p>
<p class="body">And behavior like attacking and you know, because it's</p>
<p class="body">Because if you think about that, like the things that here's the thing that most disturbed me right when that happened that I would see people who would be defending that</p>
<p class="body">Online, who would say, well, you know he's not like really a journalist you know, because like whatever they would say about him, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know he's like a propagandist or he's like really siding with like the proud boys or one of these groups</p>
<p class="body">Or you know whatever</p>
<p class="body">And it's like the misinformation thing, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like who gets to decide, right? </p>
<p class="body">What counts as a journalist? </p>
<p class="body">And I certainly don't want that decision to be made by like individual vigilantes</p>
<p class="body">Right, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the problem with Antifa is the name</p>
<p class="body">Calling it Antifa, like anti fascist like you're</p>
<p class="body">Like, well of</p>
<p class="body">Course or some anti fascist? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, right, right? </p>
<p class="body">Who wouldn't be? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's the problem</p>
<p class="body">It's but like let's define fascism</p>
<p class="body">Put put up the definition of fascism and this is part of where the problem lies</p>
<p class="body">Like when we discuss fascism, whether we're discussing the connection between the corporate interests and the government or like</p>
<p class="body">What is the? </p>
<p class="body">What is the technical definition of what a fascist is so like? </p>

<p class="body">Where where would you press Wikipedia? </p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Just Google it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">OK yeah, here fascism, a form of far right authoritarianism</p>
<p class="body">Ultra nationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy that rose to prominence in the early 20th century of Europe</p>
<p class="body">There's other definitions of that though</p>
<p class="body">That's the Wikipedia definition</p>
<p class="body">The problem</p>
<p class="body">Wikipedia is sometimes it gets ideologically captured</p>
<p class="body">A political philosophy, movement or regime</p>
<p class="body">That exalts nation and often race above the individual, and stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader</p>
<p class="body">Severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition</p>
<p class="body">I don't see that in our country</p>
<p class="body">Here's the other one, though a tendency towards</p>
<p class="body">Or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control</p>
<p class="body">The problem with that is when you're trying to</p>
<p class="body">Control by violence and St action and throwing milkshakes at people you're trying to control</p>
<p class="body">The way they behave, and they think</p>
<p class="body">And that's a form of fascism</p>
<p class="body">It's a kind of fascism which you're doing is</p>
<p class="body">In a sense, you're intimidating people into not opposing your perspective</p>
<p class="body">You have large groups of people, they incite violence</p>
<p class="body">They lit the ******* apartment building of the the Portland Mayor, Portland</p>
<p class="body">One of the great things about is it's the least fascist place on Earth</p>
<p class="body">It is literally</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">The most open minded progressive city on the entire continent, the</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">United, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You don't think Nazis are about to</p>
<p class="body">Take over Portland, there's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Not a ******* chance and yet that's the stronghold of Antifa, and that's the place where they find the most fascism</p>
<p class="body">They have to combat against</p>
<p class="body">It's a form of bullying</p>
<p class="body">It's a form of gangs</p>
<p class="body">It's a they're trying to enforce their ideology, and unfortunately, they're ******* mayor</p>
<p class="body">Has let them go so far with it that even he's pushing back now he's calling for greater police protection and they're they're trying to enforce laws now and arrest people</p>
<p class="body">And because he was being targeted so much that he turned it around and is like we have to do something about these people like now you</p>
<p class="body">Think now you think like it's</p>
<p class="body">It's like a gang man</p>
<p class="body">It's like they they get they're they're into this ideology and they're into this whole community of like stopping these fascists and they're looking for them when they don't even exist</p>
<p class="body">The technical definition of fascism is not running rampant in ******* Portland</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">It's just not no</p>
<p class="body">No it's not</p>
<p class="body">And I think that like if you want to say like there are like far right groups who might commit hate crimes etc, then like first of all I actually don't think that a lot of people who do stuff like this would be like just</p>
<p class="body">I'm I'm skeptical that like they're really going to be the ones who are who are going to, you know, do something there</p>
<p class="body">But like if</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do something there in what way? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh that like that like that like if you have like actual fascists who are like showing up with guns, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that like you know, yeah, I mean like what like I don't think</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're gonna run out of dodge</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I don't think most people who sign up for stuff like this</p>
<p class="body">This is a point Michael Brooks made to me like after the</p>
<p class="body">In Michigan in 2020 there were there was, uh, like some protests at the state Capitol over lockdown stuff where like lots and lots of people actually had guns there he was, like, oh, where's where's Antifa? Here, right? You know, like like? </p>
<p class="body">You know why not, right and? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is that when they were trying to kidnap the governor? </p>
<p class="body">That's the FBI red LED operation</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, that was that was before that, but that was that was like that</p>
<p class="body">Was related, yeah, it was the same kind of stuff, so I mean like the protests were like real the the governor plot</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Same kind of stuff</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Seems like that was just the like equivalent for this stuff and like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It was ginned up by the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah it was. It was like one of those. It was like one of those cases, like with the Post 911 security state where you have some like</p>
<p class="body">You know mentally ill Muslim loner who like the FBI spends like 2 years convincing them you know to join their fake fake fake terror plot</p>

<p class="body">You need to blow your</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Shoes up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">They finally say yes and they arrest them</p>
<p class="body">You know, like like it seems like way too close to that for comfort</p>
<p class="body">But I guess I guess the thing that's</p>
<p class="body">That might connect to something we were talking about earlier about Antifa</p>
<p class="body">I think that the reason one reason why people end up like obsessing with like about like marginal far right groups like they they proud boys are not about to like</p>
<p class="body">You know March on Washington and like you know and and install, you know whoever is</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, the also that guy the ******* head of the proud boys was in the FBI too</p>

<p class="body">That's true</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That was the craziest thing when, when that turned out there was the one guy who was</p>
<p class="body">What was his name Enrique? </p>
<p class="body">Something or another? </p>
<p class="body">Who turned out to be an FBI informant that he was the the head of the proud boys, that they were always interviewing him on television after Gavin McInnes, who started as a LARP, he started literally as a joke like it was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's like yeah, it's like, uh? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It was based on a Broadway musical</p>
<p class="body">That's why they called it proud boys</p>
<p class="body">They were joking around</p>
<p class="body">And then it became a thing and then a bunch of people</p>
<p class="body">Once you created an organization, then a bunch of people can join in</p>
<p class="body">Then they infiltrate it and then they decide to radicalize it</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, proud boys leader Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant</p>
<p class="body">Like what in the **** man? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's like and they turn the McCarthy period when like half of the people at like some like little local Communist Party meeting would be FBI agents because they were devoting so many resources to like trying to</p>
<p class="body">To stop this, like very marginal, you know this very marginal group you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Know so people were upset at you because of the Endino thing that you didn't think that was I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">People, people were up</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And obviously it's just not a way to treat a</p>
<p class="body">Person like no no it's</p>
<p class="body">Beat him up and and he's the if you ever met Andy</p>
<p class="body">He's just tiny Asian gay man</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, yeah, right</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">The idea that this guy is this jackbooted thug that's there to take down, you know, democracy is ******* preposterous</p>
<p class="body">No, no, it is</p>
<p class="body">And and I think that the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And I think that like the problem is like when you make an obvious point like, hey, there's absolutely no justification for like physically attacking this guy</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know that they that like</p>
<p class="body">That that's that's that's insane behavior that, like this, is</p>
<p class="body">This serves no good purpose</p>
<p class="body">You know whatsoever that like a lot of the things that people said about at the time when they're trying to justify it were, you know, turned out to be ******** Which is also true that</p>
<p class="body">Also, you know and also, by the way, I don't want to set the precedent that like we're going to have St violence where people who like you know somebody, decides they don't count as a real journalist and and that they're like helping bad people or creating dangerous effects or something</p>
<p class="body">And they could just attack them like I mean</p>
<p class="body">Why you know? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, I'm sure of you know</p>
<p class="body">I'm sure I've written lots of stuff for Jacobin that</p>
<p class="body">People would say that about right, but what is it like like? </p>

<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Journalist, this is the other thing, like what defines a journalist like? </p>
<p class="body">How do you decide who is and isn't a giant? </p>
<p class="body">Do you have to be connected to a specific organization? </p>
<p class="body">Because there are many people that are connected to specific organizations that are propagandist</p>
<p class="body">Do you have to have a degree in journalist journalism? </p>
'cause there's many people? </p>
<p class="body">That have a degree in journalism that are liars</p>
<p class="body">And they work for gigantic corporations and they spew out all the nonsense that this corporation wants them to say</p>
<p class="body">Like what is a journalist? </p>
<p class="body">No, absolutely</p>
<p class="body">Should rigid criteria for what is I mean? </p>
<p class="body">Couldn't you not be a person who believes in the truth? </p>
<p class="body">Who decides to dedicate yourself to discussing things and researching things and doing it in a very honest and like? </p>
<p class="body">Doing it as a person in good faith and putting out the information as you've discovered it, like isn't that journalism like who decides who's a journalist? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean certainly nobody at Wiki leaks had a journalism degree, and I'm really glad that that exists, right, sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">How about Edward Snowden? </p>
<p class="body">Does that was what he did? </p>
<p class="body">Does that count as journalism? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I've heard people say that Glenn Greenwald is not a journalist like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<p class="body">Which is which is ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's preposterous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean he broke, I mean</p>
<p class="body">You know he like whatever you think about Glenn or his politics or any of that stuff</p>
<p class="body">I mean, just from a journalism perspective like first with the the NSA revelations and then again in Brazil</p>
<p class="body">You know with you know with the material that like helped free the former president, you know who's who was, who was unjustly imprisoned</p>
<p class="body">Like that that's, I mean that's the most important stuff</p>
<p class="body">Journalism can do, right? </p>
<p class="body">So if that's not journalism, you know</p>
<p class="body">If that's not journalism, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like I don't know why journalism is is important</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But yeah, what is journalism? </p>
<p class="body">Once you go to stub stack, you're not a</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Journalist anymore yeah</p>
<p class="body">And and I think that the and I think that's incredibly dangerous because you could imagine</p>
<p class="body">I mean look, you don't have to imagine you could just look at what actually has happened with Julian Assange, right? </p>
<p class="body">That they that like that, you know, like the the government says, like you know that, oh, there's no freedom of the press issue here</p>
'cause that's not really journalism</p>
<p class="body">He's just like some kind of you know enabler of terrorism</p>
<p class="body">You know, because he, he did this</p>
<p class="body">That's certainly not a road that I want to go down</p>
<p class="body">But the problem is you as obvious as so many of these points are that like</p>
<p class="body">It's there's absolutely no good justification for physically attacking a non combatant you know, like somebody who isn't like going and you know, like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right and mocking and laughing when you hit him in the head with a ******* milkshake like what it was that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No, it's you know, it's terrible behavior</p>
<p class="body">You so like you make that obvious point</p>
<p class="body">You make the point</p>
<p class="body">We're just making about journalism and it's</p>
<p class="body">It's like on the face of it</p>
<p class="body">You think, OK, this is like this is all obvious, but the problem is it's that like</p>
<p class="body">Team, like rooting for your team, behavior that like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You're willing to accept horrible behavior as long as it's enforcing your ideology</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and then if and then if somebody like me said, you know, says that, I think that you know, like you know that that I think this is bad then</p>
<p class="body">Oh see so you're not being loyal to the team, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like you're siding with Andy, know who's on the other team and you know you're you're siding against people who are, you know</p>
<p class="body">Or on your team you know</p>
<p class="body">So like they'll just have a reaction to that</p>
<p class="body">That's not actually about like the thing itself, or like showing what's wrong with the argument</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and I should be really clear I'm</p>
<p class="body">Not like I had Andino on my podcast and I was skeptical of a lot of things</p>
<p class="body">He was saying one of them that he had traumatic brain injury</p>
<p class="body">From that I was like what kind of brain injury do you have from that? </p>
<p class="body">Like what are you talking about now? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I know originally they like there was these reports that there was like concrete</p>
<p class="body">There was like mixed the milkshakes somehow and that just sounds like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No listen man, I watched him get hit with that</p>
<p class="body">That's like that's not what gives you brain damage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, it's it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I know what gives</p>
<p class="body">You brain damage</p>
<p class="body">You gotta get you gotta get hit like if that guy got hit with a ******* piece of concrete he would go down</p>
<p class="body">OK, he's not gonna take it on the chin and keep walking and get a traumatic brain</p>
<p class="body">Injury from a milkshake</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's silly, no</p>
<p class="body">And look and I think that</p>
<p class="body">There were some other shots that he took that</p>
<p class="body">Weren't on camera</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And I think I think Andy know like as somebody like the issue is not do I like Andy? </p>
'cause I actually don't right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean like I think don't you like so? </p>
<p class="body">He wrote an article</p>
<p class="body">That was, I think it was for quelette</p>
<p class="body">I'm not sure about that part, right? </p>
<p class="body">Might have been somewhere else, but he wrote an article about visiting Britain where he was claiming basically that there were, like, you know, parts of London that were like under Sharia law, or that you know like it, and his evidence was that</p>
<p class="body">Was that there were like no drinking signs that like it's it's been pointed out that like other like non Muslim neighborhoods they have the same things, right? </p>
'cause you're just not allowed to drink in certain places</p>
<p class="body">You know, under generally applicable laws, I think that he's you know and and I think that I think that probably in general, right like that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He's a provocateur</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I think I think he's a</p>
<p class="body">I think he's a provocateur and I think that he's</p>
<p class="body">I I too have a lot of questions you know about about</p>
<p class="body">The honesty, or at least the commitment to sort of checking things you know before you before you go into print with them and and my sense is that you know his his politics are completely different from mine</p>
<p class="body">But none of that matters for this right? </p>
<p class="body">Like none of that is the point, right? </p>
<p class="body">I don't want just like you know, if we're talking about like</p>
<p class="body">You know, should we have a taboo against like physically assaulting journalists, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, physically assaulting people you disagree</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">With you know then like, yeah we should and it should be anybody, right you know</p>
<p class="body">But like also, I think that you know it shouldn't depend on whether you think they're honest</p>
<p class="body">It shouldn't depend on any of that stuff, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that that's that</p>
<p class="body">That should is not something that should be happening, and I think it's a bad door to</p>
<p class="body">I think it's a bad door to open up</p>
<p class="body">And but I you know, I think that that's something in the book that people a lot of people</p>
<p class="body">I shouldn't say a lot of people, most people who got mad at it never cracked it open</p>
<p class="body">But like you know, but like it's a lot of some of the people who did get mad at it, you know, because they read it had a problem with that</p>
<p class="body">I think some of the Dave Chappelle stuff in the first chapter because, you know, they thought I was like defending a transphobe</p>
<p class="body">You know, like I think that that was</p>
<p class="body">You know that that was an issue with some people</p>
<p class="body">You know trying to you know, I think that this stuff in later in the you know in the book</p>
<p class="body">That just in general, I think a lot of people who got mad about it sort of misinterpreted the sort of main claim in a crazy way, right? </p>
<p class="body">That, like you know, in other words that they thought that the main thing that I was saying</p>
<p class="body">Was that like online? </p>
<p class="body">Cancellation is like the the most important part of problem in the world</p>
<p class="body">Or you know something like that</p>
<p class="body">And that's not what I think</p>
<p class="body">You know what I think is that this is not a way that you should act towards people one because on a human level it's just a toxic way to to operate</p>
<p class="body">And two, if you actually want to win people over to ideas that you think are important so you can accomplish something that's important in the real world</p>
<p class="body">Then getting bogged down in all of this kind of, you know, online **** throw in and you know trying to get people fired and all of that stuff for all the reasons that we're talking about, I think it's the I think it's like the worst, most counterproductive thing you could</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do I think there's also a real issue with communicating through social media? </p>
<p class="body">It's such a</p>
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<p class="body">It's a way of communicating that takes away so much of what it is to be a human to be a human is to look at a person to have a conversation with them, look them in the eyes, to talk about things in depth, to recognize their perspective</p>
<p class="body">Allow them to talk so you give them</p>
<p class="body">There's a a sense of camaraderie your your</p>
<p class="body">Two human beings expressing ideas</p>
<p class="body">With social media, you're just printing something out and you're throwing it out into the ether</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, of course</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And then the other person responds</p>
<p class="body">And then you don't see each other</p>
<p class="body">You don't like trying to be biting and nasty, and you don't</p>
<p class="body">The way you win is through vitriol</p>
<p class="body">It's a ****** way to communicate and one of the best ways to get attention is to be the biggest CTT like</p>
<p class="body">That's that's how people get attention online</p>
<p class="body">To say the most mean the most</p>
<p class="body">Vicious thing that you can and it's like a fun little game</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah, and you get</p>
<p class="body">Totally and you get validation for being like the first person to like throw</p>
<p class="body">You know throwing the first stone right like the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And people like support you because they wish they had said it or they don't want to be the person to stick their neck out, but they'll</p>
<p class="body">Like it because the</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, go get him</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, or get him Ben</p>

<p class="body">Go it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, or they just don't like or or</p>
<p class="body">They just like you know they like the tweet, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that like we got that guy and then they just never think about it again or sometimes like if they thought about it in the 1st place like like I gave</p>
<p class="body">You know there's a</p>
<p class="body">There's a guy who I am</p>
<p class="body">Wendell Potter</p>
<p class="body">You know who this is</p>
<p class="body">OK, so Wendell Potter used to be a health insurance executive and he would like lobby</p>
<p class="body">You know Congress, on behalf of health insurance companies and then at some point in the past, like I think like maybe 15 years ago or something, I'm not sure about the timing</p>
<p class="body">He he decided, you know, like he had a crisis of conscience about doing that and he he he left the industry and he he you know he</p>
<p class="body">He started like what he's done since then</p>
<p class="body">Is he just campaigns for Medicare for all right? </p>
<p class="body">So this is this is a</p>
<p class="body">This is a really good person and</p>
<p class="body">He had</p>
<p class="body">Uh, I remember back in with this. This was like spring 2021. Maybe Wendell Potter tweeted out something like the fact that people don't understand how much Medicare for all would help us even during this time when people were losing on health insurance. You know, because of</p>
<p class="body">You know the economic disruptions</p>
<p class="body">All this stuff shows</p>
<p class="body">How many people bought the lies that I used to tell, you know, when I was a health insurance executive and this guy who I'm not going to name 'cause I don't want to like, you know, shame, this guy</p>
<p class="body">That's not the point, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, but like is</p>
<p class="body">This guy quote tweeted that right? Like he just probably saw it on his feet and you know, he didn't really know him from he quote tweeted it and said, and I quote, Oh my God, this ******* ***** ** **** actually admitted it and that got like 20,000 likes before enough people like told him who Wendell Potter was that he finally like took down the tweet and what gets me about that example</p>
<p class="body">Is that? </p>
<p class="body">If whoever if the guy who originally tweeted that had literally just clicked on Wendell Potter's name on the top of the tweet, that would have taken him to their pro, you know his profile picture, where he would have seen like all these, you know, like names that like have like for Medicare, for all the title, and he would have realized, like what point he was making when he tweeted that</p>
<p class="body">But why would you do 5 seconds of research about somebody before denouncing them when you can get that little endorphin rush from, like, you know? </p>
<p class="body">You're a ***** ** **** on Twitter or then you could get all those likes and RT tweets</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Do you know who Alan Levin events is that he's a writer? </p>
<p class="body">He's got a very interesting perspective on this and he calls</p>
<p class="body">Twitter and social media processed information the same way processed food is bad for you that processed information ultra processed where it's down to instead of a conversation with someone, it's down to quote tweeting a thing completely out of context and trying to rule with them</p>
<p class="body">Oh my God, this ***** ** **** just admitted it like that kind</p>
<p class="body">Of thing that's an example of like</p>
<p class="body">Cultural process information and when he said that it was like one of those aahe movement moments where it's like that's what it is</p>
<p class="body">That is the thing that separates human beings and normal human interaction between social media interaction</p>
<p class="body">It's too easy to do, it's too simple</p>
<p class="body">It's like basically like fast food or like some sort of</p>
<p class="body">Process ******* snack</p>
<p class="body">It's terrible for you</p>
<p class="body">It's terrible for your brain</p>
<p class="body">And people engage in it easily</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and much like those other examples, the profit incentives of the companies that run it you know, are</p>
<p class="body">All in favor of people doing all this stuff, because the more people are doing that, the more the more minutes per day their eyeballs are on Twitter, sure, but I think you know</p>

<p class="body">Or they're</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Almost a simplistic version of because I don't think they meant that</p>
<p class="body">I don't think they created it in order to get people to do it that way</p>
<p class="body">I think they created it like when you go back and look at Twitter what it initially was</p>
<p class="body">It was like you had put at and then your name is like is going to the movies</p>
<p class="body">Like you would even talk about yourself in the third person you know, like at Joe Rogan's going to the gym like that's how people did it and then slowly but surely it became a way where people espoused opinions and then it became Arab Spring</p>
<p class="body">And then, like it became all sorts of different ways that people express themselves</p>
<p class="body">They like this idea that it started out with this insidious notion</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it necessarily started out with an insidious notion, but I do think that the ways that it's changed over time are ones that like just just the fact that like that, like you know, likes and retweets and all that stuff are are part of it, I do think</p>
<p class="body">It's a kind of feedback mechanism</p>
<p class="body">Like you know, Jon Jon Ronson book, so you've been publicly shamed</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, like he talks about that at the end</p>
<p class="body">He uses the analogy of</p>
<p class="body">Those, like electronic speeding signs that will show you as you like, drive by like what the you know how fast you're driving and you know what the and what the speed limit is and he points out that on paper there's no reason that should work because they're not giving you any information you don't already have, right every car has a speedometer in it that like tells you you know how fast you're driving a normal low tech speed sign would tell you what the speed limit is</p>
<p class="body">But just that moment of validation that you get from driving past and see the two numbers come together actually does seem to get people to drive more slowly and it reduces accidents</p>
<p class="body">Tons of studies about this that show that it does that</p>
<p class="body">And in that case it's that kind of like immediate feedback loop of validation is a good thing, but in social media that kind of immediate feedback loop of validation that, like you're going to get, you know 10,000 people who you know like and retweet you know, because you said you know you said somebody is a ***** ** **** or you know whatever is is incredibly toxic. I think it it makes it</p>
<p class="body">Harder for you know, harder to communicate with people</p>
<p class="body">It makes it harder to even listen to what somebody who disagrees with you</p>
<p class="body">Thanks for long enough that you could think about how to convince them</p>
<p class="body">You know that to try to persuade them of your point of view and it makes us even more atomized than than we are already, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like if you spend</p>
<p class="body">You know, if you spend all of your time scrolling, which again, maybe it wasn't the original intention, but I think that like the more time people spend scrolling through their social media feeds, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know the better it is for the bottom line of these companies when you agree with that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh for sure</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, and it's</p>
<p class="body">Also hugely addictive with the likes and the retweets and all that stuff</p>
<p class="body">They just made things incredibly addictive and the numbers when people look at numbers they want to look at how many likes they get for something and then when they find certain things they get more likes</p>
<p class="body">They gravitate towards those things you see in the</p>
<p class="body">Social dilemma documentary</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I actually haven't seen it, but I I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Know what it is</p>
<p class="body">It's really good</p>
<p class="body">It's really good, and it it, it highlights a terrifying future because they're essentially saying like this leads to like this massive polarization of these perspectives in this country</p>
<p class="body">And it's like it's, like, almost like setting us up for</p>
<p class="body">A civil war</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's going to be a civil war, but I do think that I</p>
<p class="body">I do think that you're going to get a lot of more people who get all of their sort of</p>
<p class="body">Emotional connection to politics is about like getting mad at people who are on the other team and not even getting mad</p>
<p class="body">At people with power</p>
<p class="body">Who are who are on the other team? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">But just like getting mad at whoever right like like like the way that after the 2016 election, something that</p>
<p class="body">I felt like I hadn't seen before was the amount of time that people were spending talking about</p>
<p class="body">You know Trump voters just like ordinary people who voted for Trump</p>
<p class="body">That seems crazy to me because I mean especially after 2020. You know, we're like the, you know the turn out was ridiculously high in both, both both sides</p>
<p class="body">So like you've got like 70 however, million people that you're just going to like write off, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like they're just like unredeemable, you know like that they're they're</p>
<p class="body">Of deplorables, yeah, they're just</p>
<p class="body">They're just irredeemable deplorables like I don't know how you think that you're going to accomplish anything right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like if you if</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">They're not thinking like that, though, and that they're not thinking in this like broad perspective</p>
<p class="body">They're not like looking at like what's best for the human race</p>
<p class="body">What's best for the community of the United States or my city or my my country? </p>
<p class="body">No, they're not thinking like that</p>
<p class="body">I'm just thinking like what feels good</p>
<p class="body">What feels good is like **** you Trump supporter</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, no, exactly like, not like</p>
<p class="body">Look, I mean one of the, you know, like one of the reasons I always thought that Bernie Sanders would have won the 2016 election if he'd been the nominee. Is that there are? </p>
<p class="body">I'm not saying all of them, I'm not even saying most of them, but I think there's a chunk of people who voted for Trump in two</p>
1016 who absolutely? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Would have voted for Bernie I think so too</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, I I don't have any doubt in my mind</p>
<p class="body">I think there's a lot of people who want a person that has like a legitimate like a really well thought out perspective that they have been consistent with their entire career</p>
<p class="body">That's Bernie Sanders like, and he really does look out for the working person</p>
<p class="body">It really does look out for working families</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And if you go back and like see clips from him from like the 1980s, right? It's all the same stuff. So this</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah all the same **** so this why why comedians like what about comedians that made you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so I mean, I think that's an example of a larger thing, but I think it's a really interesting example, right? </p>
<p class="body">So I think the larger thing that it's an example of is that when people, this is my claim about why a lot of people on the left get sucked into this, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, when people feel like they have no real power to</p>
<p class="body">It changed anything like big and structural that actually matters</p>
<p class="body">They they get sucked into picking fights that they think they can't win, right? </p>
<p class="body">If you can't win what the ones that matter, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know like like, then find a way to care about you</p>
<p class="body">Know the stuff that is not going to change</p>
<p class="body">Change the world for better but you know, but you derive some kind of satisfaction from so if it's like</p>
<p class="body">You know, yelling at Dave Chappelle, you know then like, that's that's something that that's something that can can scratch that itch</p>
<p class="body">You know, if it's if it's Antifa, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like look the things that actually create like misery for working people in the United States</p>
<p class="body">Or big structural things that can't be solved by punching anybody in the face, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that that that's not going to</p>
<p class="body">That's not going to work</p>
<p class="body">But you know, you can get diverted to to, you know, to finding someone finding someone you know you can punch and you know you get like that sense of of satisfaction</p>
<p class="body">And I think that I think that what the comedy example really shows is the way that people get sucked into this way of viewing the world</p>
<p class="body">That's all about individual moralism, right? </p>
<p class="body">Is this person a good person or a bad person? </p>
<p class="body">Is that person a good person or a bad person and it becomes just this like constant? </p>
<p class="body">Inventory at the soul</p>
<p class="body">And I think that we're doing that so much that we almost don't even notice that we're doing it</p>
<p class="body">It's just almost like goes without saying that like that's how you would interact with this stuff</p>
<p class="body">And so I think that</p>
<p class="body">Comedy, you know as a form of entertainment and when it's really good as a form of art you know as as something that can</p>
<p class="body">You know help us kind of look at, you know, look at the world around us and it's slightly different angle</p>
<p class="body">You know than than we would in the normal course of things</p>
<p class="body">You know, 'cause it kind of holds things up in a, you know, in a different way</p>
<p class="body">I think that that can only work if it's operating in a space where people aren't constantly thinking about like oh, is this, you know? </p>
<p class="body">Is this guy a good guy or a bad guy? </p>
<p class="body">Is is this? </p>
<p class="body">Is this joke that I'm about to tell, you know, like something that is is morally? </p>
<p class="body">Acceptable or not right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like like if you're in that space, I don't think you're going to be able</p>
<p class="body">To, I don't think you're going to be able</p>
<p class="body">To to do it right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's an interesting thought that people will attack things that they think that they can have an impact on</p>
<p class="body">Instead of going after these big impossible problems that seem insurmountable</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean look perfect example. Think about the summer of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd there was this</p>
<p class="body">Wave of protests and riots and unrest that was like without precedent in a very, very long time if ever right and</p>
<p class="body">All of that was originally about police violence, but how much has actually changed in terms of how policing works in the United States since then, there were some cities that cut budgets for a while most of</p>
<p class="body">Them have put it back, they you know, but in terms of things like how? </p>
<p class="body">Easy, it is to hold a police officer accountable, you know if</p>
<p class="body">If they you know if they use violence in unjustified way, I don't think that's I don't think that's gotten much, much better</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, it's changed in New York City in New York City police officers can be civilly liable now</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and that's a good step, you know</p>
<p class="body">I think that I think that I don't think it's a complete solution because for one thing I think a lot of people who are most likely to end up in these situations</p>
<p class="body">Are not into good position to afford you know good civil right? </p>
<p class="body">You know good legal representation</p>
<p class="body">I know sometimes in a high profile case he'll get people doing IT pro bono</p>
<p class="body">You know who are good lawyers, but you know, I again, I think it's a good step</p>
<p class="body">I don't</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it</p>
<p class="body">I don't think it addresses</p>
<p class="body">Most of the problem, but I think it's it's something that support for sure, but here's the thing</p>
<p class="body">I think that much more than people like you know, actually changing how policing works in America is really heavy lift</p>
<p class="body">But what's really easy is you know getting you know every you know corporation in the world to like</p>
<p class="body">Put out some sort of Black Lives Matter thing right? </p>
<p class="body">Like that's that's easy</p>
'cause it doesn't cost them anything like why? </p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Wouldn't they just do that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's also good for business</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Sure, yeah</p>
<p class="body">Org capitalism</p>
<p class="body">Yeah yeah yeah</p>

<p class="body">You know, I</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Mean that's the thing like this woke signaling that you know that your business is a part of the good side and that you should support this business</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, no, absolutely it again like it, it doesn't</p>
<p class="body">You know, like like it earns them some goodwill</p>
<p class="body">It doesn't cost them anything</p>
<p class="body">Why wouldn't they do that right like that? </p>
<p class="body">Doesn't that does very little to solve</p>
<p class="body">Like anything that any of this stuff is supposed to be about</p>
<p class="body">But but again, it's it's it's easy, right? </p>
<p class="body">Or like when you know people like knocking down statues which don't get me wrong, I don't think there should be statues of Confederate generals</p>
<p class="body">You know, in in, in cities you know? </p>
<p class="body">I mean, I don't think that's something we should glorify, but I also saw a lot of like after the really bad statues came down</p>
<p class="body">People started going after Gray area statues and</p>
<p class="body">You know it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">George Washington statues</p>
<p class="body">What's interesting about the civil war</p>
<p class="body">The civil War statues is, many of them actually came up</p>
<p class="body">They were put up during the civil rights demonstrations of the 1960s, and they're really cheaply made. These like ****** responses to the change that was happening in the country</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, right, so again, I think that like</p>
<p class="body">Should you have like? </p>
<p class="body">Should there be a statue? </p>
<p class="body">Strawberry Lee, Robert E</p>
<p class="body">Lee no, I don't think so</p>
<p class="body">But I also think it's revealing that people end up getting</p>
<p class="body">Spending this much time on these purely symbolic things, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like we've got rid of all of the really objectionable statues, and now we'll say, well, how about George Washington? </p>
<p class="body">How about you over right and then you you search for things that you know you can change the name of it, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, like my, you know, my mom has gone really into to bird watching in her retirement and she told me that there's like some kind of warbler that's named after a Confederate general</p>
<p class="body">And people are like trying to</p>
<p class="body">Like get that changed</p>
<p class="body">It's like OK, you're really like, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But digging deep</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">They're digging deep, right? </p>
<p class="body">Right, so you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">This is kind</p>
<p class="body">Of weird though, you know like if</p>
<p class="body">You have like a Hitler warbler like</p>
******* weed celebrating</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Like yeah no and like whatever I mean</p>
<p class="body">I guess if T shirt is that sure I</p>
<p class="body">Guess if I if I were in the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">He had a warbler with a ******* wing up in the air like a Nazi like</p>
<p class="body">Hey hey</p>
<p class="body">Saying yeah but but again, why did you? </p>
<p class="body">Why comedians in the title and like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, yeah so so I think that I think 'cause I think it's an example that makes it really dramatic because</p>
<p class="body">Comedians don't and really can't exercise political power</p>
<p class="body">They might, you know, influence to a certain extent</p>
<p class="body">The way that people think about certain things, but</p>
<p class="body">Uh, nobody is. You know, nobody who's who's doing comedy is is making decisions. You know that that directly directly impact people's lives so</p>
<p class="body">So if you were actually trying to to do that, you know, like if you're actually trying to affect real change</p>
<p class="body">This doesn't make any sense</p>
<p class="body">What I think it is is it's a symptom of how extreme this kind of moralistic approach to politics</p>
<p class="body">Can get right that like you're this concerned with like constantly, you know testing, you know whether somebody is a is a good person or a bad person or they ever said anything that you know that might show them to like to really be a bad person and nothing could ever just be a bad moment, right? </p>
<p class="body">That you know that that it has to be like this is the moment where you really revealed</p>
<p class="body">The you know how toxic your soul was or something you know rather than just like you said something stupid because sometimes people say things that are stupid</p>
<p class="body">You know that, like I think that that kind of moralism, when it's applied to comedy? </p>
<p class="body">I think that that's I think that that's like maybe the most extreme symptom of of what I'm talking about</p>
<p class="body">Because it's one thing even to get mad at somebody because</p>
<p class="body">Of something they wrote, like in an editorial, right? </p>
<p class="body">That they're they're telling you like exactly what they think should happen</p>
<p class="body">You know that, like if I</p>
<p class="body">You know, if I write, you know, if I write something for Jacobin and you know some people get upset about that, OK, at least its Jacobin article</p>
<p class="body">I'm literally saying exactly what I think, right? </p>
<p class="body">If you're doing, you know a account like so so that last Dave Dave Chappelle, special at Netflix, you know that that people people got mad about</p>
<p class="body">And which, by the way, I, I, you know, hadn't even watched</p>
<p class="body">But since I had written this thing, you know people kept asking me what I thought, and I finally watched it</p>
<p class="body">And I thought that the way that it was portrayed as if it were this like just festival of transphobic, you know hatred was ridiculous, that in fact</p>
<p class="body">The overall theme of the special as far as those issues go was about him, like moving towards a place of greater understanding and you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">And and like and it's also kind of a love letter to his friend that committed suicide for supporting him was attacked for supporting him</p>
<p class="body">And then she jumped off a ******* building and committed suicide</p>
<p class="body">This is like</p>
<p class="body">In an homage to this person's life as long part of like I worked with Dave during the entire time he was piercing that together because we started doing shows in Austin like</p>
<p class="body">November of 2020. I mean, it might have even been earlier than that and we were working together while he was putting it together</p>
<p class="body">And he was responding to this idea that he was transphobic and he was saying like this is so crazy like this is who I am and this is about this person</p>
<p class="body">Who when I was accused of being transphobic, this person defended me and was dragged by people and there's been some talk of whether or not like how much of that was creative license because like people have tried to find like what the tweets were like, how many of them were DMS like? </p>
<p class="body">We don't know</p>
<p class="body">I mean I don't think you could dismiss that or how many of them</p>
<p class="body">Or people who actually knew her personally but then committed suicide and like this is like trying to make it's the highest form of comedy in a lot of ways, because you're trying to take this like socially sensitive issue and extract laughs from it, which is very difficult to do</p>
<p class="body">But in no way was it transphobic</p>
<p class="body">In no way was it hurtful or cruel or or mean well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, I mean actually, he's like he spent a couple minutes of the special explaining why the bathroom was in North Carolina were cruel and like</p>
<p class="body">At the end, like when he's talking about his dead friend, like one of the crucial moments comes when he's describing there like back and forth</p>
<p class="body">You know, when he he had her open for him and and</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, which is a hilarious thing</p>
<p class="body">But there is this like really moving part of it right at the at the end where you know he you know she</p>
<p class="body">She tells him you know like</p>
<p class="body">I want you to recognize that I'm going through a real human experience and like and and like</p>
<p class="body">It really sinks in and that, and the idea that watching this would make somebody more transphobic just just seems absurd to me, but what people did right is they literally quoted individual sentences that he says in it</p>
<p class="body">Like like there's one point in the special where he says</p>
<p class="body">I'm a turf right turf standing for transitioning, you know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Team turf, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Joke yeah, it's like OK, but</p>
<p class="body">Literally within like 2 minutes of him saying I'm on team turf</p>
<p class="body">He says I'm not saying that I don't think transwomen are women</p>
<p class="body">It's like, well, hold on right</p>
<p class="body">Like you know, if if you take both of those literally right, those those two, those two don't go together, but of course, that's not how comedy works</p>
<p class="body">That's like thinking that like somebody who writes a novel</p>
<p class="body">That, like every sentence of the novel, is like what they actually personally think is is is true, but</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Of course, of course, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I, I think, and I've got to think, that a lot of people who write articles like this</p>
<p class="body">Must understand that on some level, right that they that like this is not how comedy works, but I think that</p>
<p class="body">You know, sometimes it's like bad faith, they're you know they're just being dishonest</p>
<p class="body">They're definitely some of that</p>
<p class="body">But like</p>
<p class="body">Also, I think that</p>
<p class="body">Like sometimes if you get this invested in like</p>
<p class="body">Making these, like moral indictments of people over those cultural war battles, then you're just not even pausing to think about that like you're just like trying to find evidence like you're just like like sifting through it to like</p>
<p class="body">Find like it's like you know Freddie Deboer, the commentator</p>
<p class="body">OK, so Freddie Deboer is a is a writer</p>
<p class="body">He wrote a really good book about the education system called Call to smart</p>
<p class="body">And he has this essay from a few years ago called Planet of Cops, where he says that it seems to him that like increasingly everybody you know in the culture is is a is a cop now, right? </p>
<p class="body">What he means by that? </p>
<p class="body">And you know he develops the metaphor</p>
<p class="body">He says things like</p>
<p class="body">You know, oh, there's the new movie that people getting excited about you know? Well, give me, you know, give Me 2 hours and 500 words and I'll find your indictments right</p>
<p class="body">You know that it's it's like it's sort of constantly sifting through things like find evidence that people who have committed some kind of sin or or or infraction</p>
<p class="body">And and I think that like that's how people are approaching that like when they wrote these articles you know about, you know how, Oh my God, you know, the Dave Chappelle said that he was on team Turf</p>
<p class="body">You know that special like look there? </p>
<p class="body">There's a mission, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know you gotta, you gotta get those indictments right</p>
<p class="body">So you just have to sort through all of it until you can find something that you know that looks like a a smoking gun of of evidence and, and I think that it's like it's a</p>
<p class="body">Obviously it's a terrible way to write about</p>
<p class="body">Anything but I think what what's interesting to me about the example of comedy</p>
<p class="body">Is that it's sort of the most absurd possible application of of doing that, because I mean just just to be like simplistic about it for a second, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like if you're saying something in standup special, like generally speaking, not every sentence, but like you're saying it because you think it's funny, right? </p>
<p class="body">But that's which is just a different thing from saying something 'cause like oh, you know, here is exactly what I think, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's like the example that we were talking about before the podcast, which I'm I'm not gonna do 'cause it's actually in my act now that someone put a quote that I said in an article</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know</p>
<p class="body">Oh yeah, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">About what a ***** ** **** I and I'm like</p>
<p class="body">Hey you gotta put the whole quote because there's like a lot more to that and it's clearly joking, but it's that thing that they do is also because someone is getting a disproportionate and exorbitant amount of attention</p>
<p class="body">And when someone is like a Dave Chappelle</p>
<p class="body">Or myself, who's got a disproportionate amount of attention? </p>
<p class="body">There's so many people that want to look at that and go flaws</p>
<p class="body">Holes peppered keg throw rocks like and it's a normal thing to have this sort of reaction to someone who you feel</p>
<p class="body">Either their take on things isn't valid, or it's not</p>
<p class="body">This it doesn't align with your own, or there's a reason why your moral morally superior to them, because your position is better</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, yeah, no, I I think there</p>
<p class="body">I think there's a lot of that, you know, and and it's also, I mean it</p>
<p class="body">Kind of goes back to where saying earlier</p>
<p class="body">About the</p>
<p class="body">The you know, BLM protests in the aftermath and all that stuff like if you get somebody like if I mean obviously in a case it's high profile is like Dave Chappelle like Netflix isn't going to dump him because like why would they do that? </p>
<p class="body">Like that would just be putting</p>
<p class="body">Like a lot of money on the on the table</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Well, not only that, but there's no reason to write</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Here's the thing</p>
<p class="body">It's like if Dave Chappelle was saying all trans people who would die should</p>
<p class="body">Sure, and we they're not human</p>
<p class="body">OK, yeah, get rid of them</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Everybody would agree to that like you shouldn't put that on your network, but you cannot look at any of the things that he said and rationalize any of these accusations that people have towards him</p>
<p class="body">He is not that guy, he's a lovely guy</p>
<p class="body">If you meet him, he's one of the kindest</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Nicest, sweetest guys</p>
<p class="body">That's who he really is and it's really striking too, because if you remember when all this was going on there was like a week of the news that was all about how there's going to be this huge walkout of trans employees at Netflix remember this? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, they took a like a</p>
<p class="body">Lunch break it was like 5</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Of them, yeah there were like 5 people at it's not even clear that they</p>
<p class="body">All worked at Netflix</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Most of them didn't, and then the one of them that was there</p>
<p class="body">They found a whole bunch of racist **** that she had put on Twitter, and they're like</p>
<p class="body">Hey and then not even jokes</p>
<p class="body">Just like racist stuff, it's like</p>
<p class="body">Goddamnit, I I get what's going on</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">These are like they're humans, humans</p>
<p class="body">Flawed and you know just because they said a thing that was incorrect doesn't mean that their whatever position they have</p>
<p class="body">They can't have a good perspective on something</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and what and what kills me about that example is at that very moment that that was going on right that there was this like</p>
<p class="body">Super hyped up, you know, walkout that like got all this attention</p>
<p class="body">There was like, you know, two people on their lunch break or whatever, like at the same time there was the John Deere strike going on and that was that was, you know, thousands of people you know, we're we're, we're out on strike for to, you know, to get better, you know wages and working conditions</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">John Deere the tractors</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah Yep, Yep the the workers</p>

<p class="body">I heard that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah yeah if you go if you go back, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">I believe you, but I mean I've never heard a peep out of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well, that's the thing, right? </p>
<p class="body">So like you compare the scale of the two things and then you compare the scale of the coverage</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, one of them is jokes, but it's also jokes from the greatest living comedian that's part of the problem</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, well</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's like you and also a a guy who you you sort of associate with left wing values and progressive values and you want them to fall in line</p>
<p class="body">And I think that's part of the blowback</p>
<p class="body">Is that you know they they they want to shame him</p>
<p class="body">Into falling in line with their ideals and one of the things that he said, like when he we talked about the special and this is we did a show together and he did this speech at an arena and he's like like I am not going to comply with the way you, you know, want me to think and want me to behave</p>
<p class="body">That's not what I'm doing</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and and again like what's his response going to be realistically like? </p>
<p class="body">He's he's just going to like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
**** that's what he's gonna do, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">It's gonna be funnier and funnier</p>

<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know, but like he like the idea that like saying like he's a terrible person, he's a transphobe like is going to get him to like see things more from your perspective</p>
<p class="body">In fact he talks about this in the special right that like he</p>
<p class="body">You know he has the thing about the woman who like followed him out to the parking lot or whatever to you know to to give him a hard time</p>
<p class="body">And the point is that, like all of that, like his reaction was just **** you, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like, of course, it is right, you know</p>
<p class="body">But like then like actually meeting this trans woman and like having this, you know, like like you</p>
<p class="body">Know like you</p>
<p class="body">Know having the interactions that they had and like having that mean something to him, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like that that</p>
<p class="body">Like that did way more probably to get him to see things the way that people were yelling at him</p>
<p class="body">Wanted him to see them</p>
<p class="body">Then like people, just like saying you know that like 'cause if if you say like if somebody wants to like shut you down or silence you, or like berate you until you you know you stop thinking what you think</p>
<p class="body">Then I I mean maybe like if somebody is powerless enough, they'll just shut up because they don't want to deal with it, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, but like otherwise, like one thing that's not going to do is to get them to say OK, now I see you're right</p>
<p class="body">Right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Especially if you're distorting their perception</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Like like they might say that</p>
<p class="body">They might say the words if they think they have to, right, but</p>
<p class="body">They're not going to think it</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Now, when you wrote this book like</p>
<p class="body">What what inspired you? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, so I think there were a few things that that had been that had been going on and it kind of all started to to build for a for a while that I was I was getting frustrated that a lot of people who</p>
<p class="body">I align with on most things were getting sucked into what I, how the way I see it in the book right that there that like that these these kinds of what I call pathologies of powerlessness, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know that you're because you know that you can't, you know, accomplish things that actually matter</p>
<p class="body">You end up getting sucked into all of this nonsense</p>
<p class="body">You spend all of your time trying to prove yourself to other people you already agree with</p>
<p class="body">You know and and to, and to denounce you know people for for not agreeing with you in ways that are not going to</p>
<p class="body">You know lead to a single person getting health care or a single workplace being unionized</p>
<p class="body">You know any of those</p>
<p class="body">Any of those things? </p>
<p class="body">And and I think there are a few examples that like were really starting to get to me at the at the time. So one of them was what happened. I remember in 2019</p>
<p class="body">The Democratic Socialists of America, which is not you know, organization I'm a member of, you know, I think it's I think it's flawed, but I think it does</p>
<p class="body">Good stuff, you know, I encourage people to do that, but</p>
<p class="body">They had this convention actually in Atlanta where I live and in which</p>
<p class="body">You know, I didn't, you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I I was there for like a minute 'cause I was like meeting with my editor</p>
<p class="body">But like I didn't, I didn't go to the thing itself</p>
<p class="body">I kind of hate sitting through meetings like in general and life, you know, but in</p>
<p class="body">But there was this montage of clips that came out afterwards that, like you know, Tucker Carlson, you know, played on Fox News and stuff like that of people announcing all of these bizarre like rules that like you weren't allowed to, like clap at the Convention because there might be people with like rare noise sensitivities and and</p>
<p class="body">And just things like this, and of course you know they're like right wingers who compiled that</p>
<p class="body">We're cherry picking like the worst, most ridiculous moments from a weekend</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But is that what the one where this person is like? </p>
<p class="body">Point of privilege is that you were a part</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Of that, I wasn't part of that, but I have</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You were in that room while that was going down</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I I wasn't in the room at that minute that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Come on, man, that is ridiculous</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No, that's it is ridiculous</p>
<p class="body">Here's what gets me about this right? </p>
<p class="body">It's like OK</p>
<p class="body">Granted the worst moments are being cherry picked, but also</p>
<p class="body">It's not</p>
<p class="body">You know they're not being made up right like this stuff actually happened, and also</p>
<p class="body">It's not even like there was somebody in there with like a hidden camera right? </p>
<p class="body">To get this footage right, they were streaming it to the</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">No, they know that</p>
<p class="body">I mean, it doesn't mean it's not still ridiculous and also the lady calling everybody comrads</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, you know</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, like what? </p>
<p class="body">What do you, what is what's going on here? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean, I mean, I think that like</p>
<p class="body">What's going like? </p>
<p class="body">What gets me about this is that knowing that this is the face you're showing to the whole world, right right, that like anybody in the world who wants to tune in and watch</p>
<p class="body">This can do that</p>
<p class="body">You're still doing this stuff like was it somebody? </p>
<p class="body">Yeah, the point of privilege thing I think was</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, please stop using gendered language</p>

<p class="body">Yes, yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Come on man, it's hilarious because it just shows like what are we ******* concentrating on your your mad that people are</p>
<p class="body">There's chatter because you're easily distracted</p>
<p class="body">How about get the **** out of here? </p>
<p class="body">Then why are you in a large crowd of people? </p>
<p class="body">What do you do at the movies? </p>
<p class="body">What do you do at a bus station? </p>
<p class="body">Shut the **** ** like you want everybody to comply</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, and as you've got some weird tick right, and why are people doing that? </p>
<p class="body">Because like you said, they can't be</p>
<p class="body">I assume they're not going through their entire lives, right? </p>
<p class="body">You know trying to to get people to do this stuff like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Maybe they are, maybe they're activists at work too</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">They are</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Maybe they're just really annoying</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I mean if so? </p>
<p class="body">If so, they're probably winning over a lot of new converts all the time, but the but you know by doing that, right? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Was that the most annoying time in that meeting, or were there more annoying times during that? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Conference yeah, I mean the stuff</p>
<p class="body">The stuff that I saw you know which was which was not you know, which was not that much of it, but the stuff I saw like that the things that made it into that montage were the most annoying things that I saw but like</p>
<p class="body">I guess what gets me about this is that knowing that everybody in the world can see this</p>
<p class="body">If you're still acting this way right, then what that shows me is that you do not</p>
<p class="body">Care at all? </p>
<p class="body">Like how any you know normal person is going to react to seeing this and I know there are people who will get this twisted when I say normal person</p>
<p class="body">All I you know it's like oh do you just mean people who are you know whatever right? </p>
<p class="body">You know, like fit some demographics or something</p>
<p class="body">Now when I say normal person I mean like</p>
<p class="body">People who aren't like bathed in this political subculture, so like stuff like that starts to seem normal to them, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like just anybody who's you know of any background, any you know? </p>
<p class="body">Any race, sexual orientation, whatever? </p>
<p class="body">Who doesn't like you know who doesn't spend all day</p>
<p class="body">Everyday thinking about politics, right? </p>
<p class="body">Is going to see this and say wait what? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But I don't even think that's a politics thing</p>
<p class="body">I think it's just a a social issue</p>
<p class="body">It's and I don't think they're thinking at all that everyone is going to see it</p>
<p class="body">I don't think that was even a consideration at all</p>
<p class="body">I think in that moment they were very self indulgent and they had the access to a microphone and they couldn't wait to yap</p>
<p class="body">And that's part of the problem with people who just can't wait to as a person who yaps professional</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I mean look, that's why I think</p>
<p class="body">I mean I</p>
<p class="body">I said earlier that I hate meetings</p>
<p class="body">This is one of the reasons why I write that they have that like it's it's always</p>
<p class="body">Every every time I've ever had to go to a meeting for anything, you know there's there's always there are always people who talk just because it's important to them that they like</p>
<p class="body">Hear themselves talk</p>
<p class="body">About it, like it's awful</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Oh yeah</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's why it's funny</p>
<p class="body">It's why that video is funny</p>
<p class="body">I mean, that's a version of that</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">No, I mean it's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">That's like the the Super Ultra progressive version of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">That yeah and and it's and you know, I get that it's funny</p>
<p class="body">It's it's also like</p>
<p class="body">Like seeing you know, seeing people who are supposedly fighting for all the things that that I am like act that way is also like painful</p>
<p class="body">It's like what what's wrong with you, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like why, why would you? </p>
<p class="body">Why would you do this right like? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">But don't you think you need someone there to go calm down Francis? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I think</p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">I mean, that's I think you</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Do right and that's part of the problem</p>
<p class="body">That's part of why I wrote the book because</p>
<p class="body">I guarantee you, however many hundreds of people who were there in that that hall, right, you know where</p>
<p class="body">That was happening</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of eye rolls</p>
<p class="body">There's a lot of eye rolls</p>
<p class="body">There's no way there weren't tons of eye rolls around like like like like I you know, I actually think they're very limited amount of time that it was around that weekend</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I'm not sure</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">I think I heard a few people, you know, do the verbal eye rolls to be right? </p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Did you know point of privilege? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">By the way, my friends say that sometimes</p>
<p class="body">Just for a</p>
<p class="body">Joke we're having a conversation like point of privilege</p>
<p class="body">And they'll just spit out something</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, right at and it's like</p>
<p class="body">I, I think</p>
<p class="body">But The thing is</p>
<p class="body">People most you know, most everybody who's who's who's rolling their eyes</p>
<p class="body">I mean, I think I actually think my friend Cal Brooks was there might have</p>
<p class="body">He might have</p>
<p class="body">Actually he might have actually like</p>
<p class="body">I had a like I think somebody came actually came over to his table and they were, you know and like told him to like not clap and you know they're like that's what's what's</p>
<p class="body">What's wrong with you and look at</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Why are you clapping your ruining life? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">You know they actually did have a little thing</p>
<p class="body">About that, but they</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Is he supposed to do this? </p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Supposed to snap fingers</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, I I, I think so or</p>

<p class="body">That was a thing they used</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Likes to do in the jazz day</p>
<p class="body">It's like a beatnik thing, right? </p>
Unknown 
<p class="body">Yeah, that's</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">And and like, but most people who are going to roll their eyes aren't going to say anything because you don't want to be the guy who say anything</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">Right, you don't be an ******* You're not there to</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Yeah, exactly</p>
<p class="body">Be an ******* right? </p>
<p class="body">Like you're there because, like you actually care about the issues that the organization is about</p>
<p class="body">You didn't sign up for this, so you could spend your time arguing with crazy people about whether clapping is OK</p>
<p class="body">So I think it's a very understandable impulse, but I think what what I started to realize when I was thinking about examples like this</p>
<p class="body">Is that? </p>
<p class="body">For a long time, like it's not like I didn't know that there were a lot of people who were ridiculous in ways like this or a lot of people who were like</p>
<p class="body">Unhelpfully moralistic, you know, and in ways like that</p>
<p class="body">You know what I was talking about in the comedy chapter of the book</p>
<p class="body">Or you know who would would excuse things that shouldn't be excused, like in the end you know you know part</p>
<p class="body">Like, but I think what I always told myself was look</p>
<p class="body">None of this matters that much like some people</p>
<p class="body">Some leftists are idiots, but whatever, like in the greater scheme of things, it's not that you know like we live in a world where there are, you know</p>
<p class="body">Imperialist wars and union busting and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera</p>
<p class="body">Then, like why spend time talking about and thinking about it? </p>
<p class="body">But then at a certain point, my perspective started to change because</p>
<p class="body">I actually think that the fact that there are all of those other issues that are more important is a reason to try to get people to stop acting like this, because if you actually care about doing something about those bigger issues, then if you look to like any like just you know, working class onlooker</p>
<p class="body">You know who you might be trying to? </p>
<p class="body">You know who like</p>
<p class="body">Ideally you'd want to reach out</p>
<p class="body">To right if</p>
<p class="body">You look like this lunatic who's like getting mad at people because they're clapping instead of doing whatever they're supposed to do with their fingers</p>
<p class="body">You know, then they're not going to have anything to do with you</p>
<p class="body">And who can blame them? </p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">You gotta weed out the freaks</p>
<p class="body">Yeah, it's like some people, just they can't see the forest for the trees, right? </p>
<p class="body">That's they're</p>
<p class="body">They're concentrated on this one thing when what you're trying to accomplish is this</p>
<p class="body">More inclusive view of socialism and with how socialism could fit into our modern culture and instead they want they want you to not clap or not talk or no, please watch your idle chatter and the noise you make</p>
<p class="body">I'm easily distracted like</p>
<p class="body">Oh my God self indulgence</p>
<p class="body">It's like it's a real problem with any group and when whenever people are trying to be like ultra sensitive and ultra progressive and ultra open minded you open the door for annoying people</p>
<p class="body">You open the door for</p>
<p class="body">People that just need a tremendous amount of</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">Attention, yeah, and there's there's got to be a way that you can</p>
<p class="body">You know, square the circle of saying like OK? </p>
<p class="body">Look are there</p>
<p class="body">Obviously you know</p>
<p class="body">Should there be more accommodations for disabled people and like society as a whole than there are sure, right? </p>
<p class="body">But anything that you could call a disability should, like you, crank the dial of accommodation up to 11 like at like all times you know no, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like like should should you, should you care about like you know not, you know, discriminating against trans people absolutely, absolutely yes</p>
<p class="body">Does that mean that like you need to be constantly on guard? </p>
<p class="body">For like anything that somebody says in a comedy set, that could be like interpreted</p>
<p class="body">If you look at in just the right light, no right? </p>
<p class="body">And I think that if you think especially that the things that should be the biggest priorities</p>
<p class="body">Are about the actual distribution of of material resources</p>
<p class="body">You know who who has</p>
<p class="body">You know who has healthcare? </p>
<p class="body">You know how much inequality do we have? </p>
<p class="body">You know how how's you know? </p>
<p class="body">Like like have we like built up the labor movement? </p>
<p class="body">All you know all of these things and trying to get the United States</p>
<p class="body">To not have this like kind of imperial world policeman, you know foreign foreign policy, which by the way</p>
<p class="body">As we've been like in this, we're talking about earlier, right in these last weeks, while people have been, you know</p>
<p class="body">Freaking out about, you know whatever is going on in the news about</p>
<p class="body">You know things that Joe Rogan said 15 years ago, or about what Whoopi Goldberg said on the view, or whatever, like</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Joe Rogan </h4> 
<p class="body">We're about to go</p>
<h4 class="speaker"> Ben Burgis </h4> 
<p class="body">To war, yeah, exactly right like this is you know</p>
<p class="body">I mean however slim the chance like the fact that there's the standoff with with the with Russia that like that has the potential if that happened right? </p>
<p class="body">I mean that would be</p>
<p class="body">And absolute like</p>
<p class="body">Human catastrophe, right? </p>
<p class="body">Even if it stayed conventional that that? </p>
<p class="body">That would be like that would be ridiculous</p>
<p class="body">And by the way, is one of many, many reasons that I wish Bernie Sanders were president right now 'cause he put out an article in the guy in the op Ed about how important it was to in the Guardian to about how important it was to, you know, negotiate to like stop this, you know from</p>
<p class="body">From from escalating</p>
<p class="body">And I'm not, you know, I'm not sure that I don't know what's going to happen, but like when I see like Biden canceling, you know the meeting with Putin</p>
<p class="body">You know, like I I get</p>
<p class="body">I get nervous and and I think that like given how destructive that would be, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like that's that's got to be</p>
<p class="body">You know like that's gotta override almost everything else right now, just in terms of like how important it is</p>
<p class="body">That we that we stop acting like this</p>
<p class="body">I don't know why the United States has to have the kind of role in the world where we're, you know, negotiating about what happens in Ukraine at all, right? </p>
<p class="body">Like like why is it important that the United States have this? </p>
<p class="body">You know, be like present in everything that happens</p>
<p class="body">It's a weird</p>
<p class="body">Role everywhere on the planet, you know</p>
<p class="body">But they that that you know when you know when the United States invaded Panama, I think that was totally unjustified</p>
<p class="body">But you know, like the you know, Gorbachev, you know what wasn't like involving himself</p>
<p class="body">You know in in that right, you know 'cause the Soviet Union didn't didn't have that that role in the world</p>
<p class="body">Not rather than we didn't either</p>
<p class="body">I'd rather that like instead of having</p>
<p class="body">Like however many hundreds of military bases the United States has all over the entire, you know, like every part of you know, every part of the world right now and constantly fighting these like low level drone wars that, like most Americans, have like forgotten that they're even happening</p>
<p class="body">You know, in in distant countries like</p>
<p class="body">I think that I think that if we redirected the kinds of resources that we spend on having this role in the world to taking care of of people's material needs in ways that</p>
<p class="body">You know it wouldn't fund all of it, but it would do a lot</p>
<p class="body">It would do a lot</p>
